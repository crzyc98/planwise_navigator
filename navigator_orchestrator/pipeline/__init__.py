"""
Pipeline orchestration components for PlanWise Navigator.

This package contains modular components for workflow definition,
stage execution, and pipeline orchestration.

NOTE: The main PipelineOrchestrator class is in pipeline_orchestrator.py at the parent level.
This package contains the modular workflow definition components that will eventually
replace the monolithic pipeline_orchestrator.py file.
