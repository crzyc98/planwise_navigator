Workflow Definition Module

Defines the workflow stages, stage definitions, and checkpoint structures for
the PlanWise Navigator pipeline orchestration. This module provides the foundation
for building year-specific workflows with proper dependency tracking and validation.

This is a pure workflow definition module with no dependencies on other pipeline
components - it serves as the foundational layer for pipeline orchestration.
