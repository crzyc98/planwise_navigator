Pipeline Hooks Module

Provides a flexible hook system for injecting custom behavior at various points in the
pipeline execution lifecycle. Supports pre/post hooks for simulation, year, and stage
events with proper error isolation and stage filtering.

This module enables extension of pipeline behavior without modifying core orchestration
logic, supporting use cases like custom logging, monitoring, validation, and cleanup.
