  Data Quality Validation Summary for Deferral Rate Escalation (Epic E035)

  This lightweight summary produces the metrics required by the schema tests while
  avoiding circular dependencies. Metrics are currently placeholders aligned to a
  healthy system (no violations). When the full escalation pipeline is enabled,
  replace these with real aggregations.
