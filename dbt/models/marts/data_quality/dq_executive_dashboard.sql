  Executive Dashboard and Compliance Attestation Framework - Story S025-02

  Provides executive-level summary dashboards and regulatory compliance attestation
  for the employee contribution calculation system.

  Executive Summary Areas:
  - Overall System Health and Performance
  - Regulatory Compliance Status (IRS, ERISA, SOX)
  - Data Quality and Integrity Assessment
  - Risk Management and Exception Reporting
  - Financial Impact and Plan Asset Summary
  - Operational Efficiency and Processing Metrics

  Compliance Attestation:
  - SOX 404 Internal Control Attestation
  - ERISA Fiduciary Responsibility Compliance
  - IRS Plan Administration Compliance
  - Audit Trail Completeness Verification
  - Data Lineage and Processing Transparency

  Executive Reporting:
  - Traffic light status indicators (Red/Yellow/Green)
  - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  - Exception and anomaly highlights
  - Trend analysis and predictive indicators
  - Action items and recommendations
*/
