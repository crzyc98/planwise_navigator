/*
  Comprehensive Compliance Monitoring Framework - Story S025-02

  Implements enterprise-grade regulatory compliance monitoring for DC plan
  contribution calculations with specific focus on IRS requirements.

  Compliance Areas Monitored:
  - IRS 402(g) Employee Deferral Limits (Zero Tolerance)
  - IRS 401(a)(17) Compensation Limits
  - Age-based Catch-up Contribution Rules
  - Plan Document Compliance Requirements
  - Anti-Discrimination Testing Preparation
  - Excess Contribution Detection and Remediation

  Regulatory Framework:
  - SOX Section 404 Internal Controls
  - ERISA Fiduciary Responsibilities
  - IRS Plan Administration Requirements
  - DOL Reporting and Disclosure Rules

  Risk Management:
  - Automated violation detection with immediate alerting
  - Trend analysis for proactive compliance management
  - Regulatory deadline tracking with advance warnings
  - Audit trail maintenance for regulatory examinations
