/*
  Data Quality Validation: Enrollment Continuity Audit

  This model validates that enrollment dates are properly tracked across simulation years
  and detects potential issues with duplicate enrollment events.

  Key validations:
  1. Employees with enrollment events should have enrollment dates in workforce snapshots
  2. Enrollment dates should not regress (become NULL after being set)
  3. Employees should not have multiple enrollment events across years
  4. New hires should get proper enrollment date tracking
