/*
Validation Queries for Auto-Escalation Bug Fix

This file contains queries to validate that the escalation bug has been fixed.

Bug Description:
- Employees with census deferral rates >= maximum_rate were incorrectly being enrolled in escalation
- Their rates were being reduced (e.g., 15% â†’ 6%)

Fix:
- Use int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator_v2 for current deferral rates instead of calculating demographic baseline
- Enhanced eligibility check: (w.current_deferral_rate > 0 AND w.current_deferral_rate < maximum_rate)

Expected Results After Fix:
- Query 1 should return 0 rows (no employees with census rate > max being escalated)
- Query 2 should return 0 rows (no employees at/above max in escalation events)
- Query 3 should show proper distribution respecting census rates
