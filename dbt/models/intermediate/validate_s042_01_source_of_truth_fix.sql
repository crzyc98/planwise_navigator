  Story S042-01 Validation: Fix Source of Truth Architecture

  This model validates the implementation of Story S042-01 requirements:
  1. Every enrolled employee has enrollment event OR registry entry
  2. NH_2025_000007 shows 6% deferral rate from enrollment event
  3. No circular dependencies (enrollment events are primary source)
  4. Clean event-driven architecture

  Expected Results:
  - Zero employees with enrollment but no events
  - NH_2025_000007 with 6% deferral rate if enrolled
  - All deferral rates sourced from enrollment events (not demographics)

/*
  Story S042-01 Validation Summary:

  This validation ensures that the source of truth architecture fix is working correctly:

  1. DATA_QUALITY_CHECK: Validates that every enrolled employee has a corresponding enrollment event
  2. SPECIFIC_TEST_CASE: Tests the specific NH_2025_000007 case mentioned in the story requirements
  3. ARCHITECTURE_CHECK: Confirms the V2 model compiles and uses event-driven architecture

  Expected Results for Successful Implementation:
  - enrolled_without_events = 0 (all enrolled employees have events)
  - NH_2025_000007 shows 6% deferral rate (if present in data)
  - V2 model compilation confirms event-driven architecture

  If any validation fails, it indicates the source of truth architecture fix needs attention.
