-- Generate new hire termination events
-- Refactored to use int_workforce_needs for termination targets
--
-- EPIC E057 FIX: Updated termination date logic to prevent invalid dates:
-- 1. Termination dates are constrained to simulation year (no 2026 dates for 2025 simulation)
-- 2. Termination dates must be at least 1 day after hire date
-- 3. Employees with late hire dates that would require termination beyond year-end are excluded
-- 4. Uses deterministic employee_id-based logic to ensure reproducible event sourcing
