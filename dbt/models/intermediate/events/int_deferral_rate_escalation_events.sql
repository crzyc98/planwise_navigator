  Generate deferral rate escalation events for eligible employees

  Epic E035: Automatic Annual Deferral Rate Escalation

  This model generates annual deferral rate increase events following the
  user requirements:
  - Default January 1st effective date
  - 1% increment amount (configurable by job level)
  - 10% maximum rate cap (configurable by job level)
  - Toggle inclusion based on hire date

  Simplified configuration:
  - Controlled by vars set from simulation_config.yaml (no demographic-based rates for escalation)
  - esc_rate, esc_cap, effective MM-DD, optional hire date cutoff, and enable toggle
  - Previous escalation history computed from prior years of this model (no circular deps)
