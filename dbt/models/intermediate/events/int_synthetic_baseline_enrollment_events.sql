/*
Epic E049: Census Deferral Rate Integration - Synthetic Baseline Event Generation
Story S049-02: Generate enrollment events for all pre-enrolled census participants

Purpose: Transform census data into synthetic enrollment events to maintain full
         event-sourcing while preserving actual participant deferral rates.

Key Features:
- Preserves exact census rates (1.3% â†’ 0.013, not default 6%)
- Generates proper event metadata for audit trail
- Normalizes rates to [0,1] with IRS cap enforcement
- Only processes employees enrolled at census date
