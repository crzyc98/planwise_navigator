/*
  Deferral Rate State Accumulator - OPTIMIZED for DuckDB Performance

  Epic E036 Story S036-03: Temporal State Tracking Implementation
  Target: <2 seconds execution per year (improved from <5s baseline)

  PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Early filtering by simulation_year using DuckDB column-store advantages
  - Efficient temporal JOIN patterns with proper column ordering
  - Vectorized processing for multi-year state transitions
  - Optimized data types for analytical workloads (DECIMAL precision, proper casting)
  - Incremental strategy: delete+insert keyed by year for idempotent re-runs
  - Removed physical indexes (unsupported by dbt-duckdb) in favor of logical partitioning

  ARCHITECTURE:
  - Uses only int_employee_compensation_by_year and int_deferral_rate_escalation_events
  - Eliminates circular dependency: int_employee_contributions â†’ this model (no circular dependency)
  - Temporal accumulation pattern: Year N uses Year N-1 state + Year N events
