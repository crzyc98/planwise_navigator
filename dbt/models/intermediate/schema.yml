    description: >
      Dependency-free model that calculates active employees for event generation.

      **Purpose:**
      Provides active employee data for event generation without circular dependencies.
      Replaces int_active_employees_by_year for all event models.

      **Approach:**
      Calculates the current active workforce by:
      1. Starting with baseline workforce from int_baseline_workforce
      2. Applying all historical events (hires, terminations, promotions, raises) up to simulation_year-1
      3. Determining who is active at the start of simulation_year

      **Circular Dependency Resolution:**
      This model only reads from:
      - int_baseline_workforce (independent)
      - fct_yearly_events (but only for years < simulation_year)
      This prevents circular dependencies with fact tables.

      **Data Integrity:**
      Ensures terminated employees don't receive events in subsequent years.

    description: >
      Primary helper model for circular dependency resolution.
      Provides active employee data from the previous year's completed workforce snapshot.

      This model creates a temporal dependency (year N depends on year N-1) instead of
      a circular dependency within the same year. It queries fct_workforce_snapshot
      for the previous simulation year and returns only active employees with all
      required contract fields.

      **Circular Dependency Resolution:**
      Eliminates the circular dependency chain by providing clean employee records
      from completed previous year data, ensuring no same-year circular references.

      DC Plan eligibility determination for all active employees across simulation years (Epic E022: Story S022-01) - SCALABLE VERSION.

      This model determines employee eligibility for DC plan participation based on days of service
      since hire date. Implements the most common eligibility pattern: waiting period after hire.

      **Business Logic:**
      - Employees become eligible after configurable waiting period (days since hire)
      - Only active employees are evaluated for eligibility
      - Eligibility determined as of January 1st of each simulation year
      - Supports immediate eligibility (0 days) and various waiting periods

      **Configuration:**
      - eligibility_waiting_days: dbt variable (default: 365 days)
      - simulation_start_year: dbt variable (default: 2025)
      - simulation_end_year: dbt variable (default: 2029)

      **Scalability:**
      - Uses dynamic macro to generate eligibility for any year range without hardcoding
      - Can handle 1 year to 100+ years of simulation without code changes
      - No more hardcoded UNION ALL statements for specific years

      **Performance:**
      - SQL-based calculation for 100K+ employees in <30 seconds
      - Materialized as table for optimal query performance
      - Dynamic year generation maintains same performance as static approach

      This helper model provides workforce state data WITHOUT enrollment events,
      breaking the circular dependency chain that was preventing E023 enrollment
      engine from functioning.

      **Purpose:**
      - Serves as clean workforce data source for eligibility determination
      - Excludes enrollment events to prevent circular dependencies
      - Maintains all other workforce event processing
      - Enables enrollment processing in separate phase

      Enrollment Events Model (Epic E023: Auto-Enrollment Orchestration Integration)

      Transforms enrollment decisions from the enrollment decision matrix into events compatible
      with the fct_yearly_events pipeline. This model bridges the enrollment orchestration system
      with the existing event sourcing architecture.

      **Event Types Generated:**
      - 'enrollment': Initial enrollment events (proactive, auto, or voluntary)
      - 'enrollment_change': Opt-out events and enrollment modifications

      **Key Features:**
      - 45-day configurable auto-enrollment window orchestration
      - Proactive enrollment timing (before auto-enrollment deadline)
      - Demographic-based enrollment probabilities and opt-out rates
      - Complete audit trail with event sequencing and validation
      - Integration with existing E022 eligibility determination

      **Performance:**
      - Processes enrollment decisions for current simulation year
      - Generates both enrollment and opt-out events in single pass
      - Maintains compatibility with existing event model structure

      Temporal State Accumulator for Enrollment Tracking (Phase 1 Fix)

      This model implements a temporal state accumulator pattern to track enrollment
      state across simulation years without circular dependencies. It builds enrollment
      state year-by-year using only fct_yearly_events and its own previous year data.

      **Key Features:**
      - Incremental materialization with unique_key=['employee_id', 'simulation_year']
      - Handles base case (first simulation year) with baseline workforce
      - Accumulates enrollment history across simulation years
      - Tracks enrollment_date, enrollment_status, and enrollment changes
      - No circular dependencies (only uses fct_yearly_events + own previous data)

      **Phase 1 Fix:**
      Replaces int_historical_enrollment_tracker to solve the issue where 321 employees
      have enrollment events but no enrollment dates in workforce snapshots.

      **Architecture:**
      - Base case: Uses int_baseline_workforce for first simulation year
      - Subsequent years: Uses previous year state from this same model + current events
      - Event-sourced: All enrollment state changes tracked through fct_yearly_events
