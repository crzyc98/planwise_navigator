{#
  Unified employee list with initial state for event-stream processing.

  This model creates a master list of every unique employee that existed
  at any point during the simulation, with their initial state (tâ‚€).

  Sources:
  1. Baseline employees from int_snapshot_base (existing workforce at start of year)
  2. New hires from fct_yearly_events (employees entering during the year)

  Each employee gets their initial state, which serves as the starting point
  for the event timeline in int_employee_event_stream.
