/*
  Optimized Enrollment Events Model (Epic E023: Auto-Enrollment Consolidation)
  
  This model consolidates the functionality of three previous enrollment models:
  - int_enrollment_events.sql (basic enrollment logic)
  - int_auto_enrollment_window_determination.sql (timing calculations) 
  - int_enrollment_decision_matrix.sql (decision routing)
  
  Performance Optimizations:
  - Single table materialization (3x storage reduction)
  - Consolidated demographic calculations (DRY principle)
  - Optimized DuckDB filtering order (columnar-friendly)
  - Single hash-based random generation per employee
  - Pre-computed eligibility checks with clear debugging
  
  Features:
  - Step-by-step eligibility filtering with audit trail
  - Demographic-based enrollment probabilities
  - Auto-enrollment and voluntary enrollment logic
  - Configurable timing windows and scope rules
  - Business rule validation and compliance checking
