-- **S031-02 OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE SNAPSHOT**
--
-- **OPTIMIZATION GOALS:**
-- - Maintain bit-level precision for all financial calculations
-- - Preserve all existing business logic and rules
-- - Enable batch processing through DuckDB columnar operations
-- - Reduce computation time by 60% through efficient SQL patterns
-- - Maintain complete audit trail and event sourcing integrity
--
-- **BUSINESS LOGIC PRESERVATION:**
-- - Identical compensation calculations (current, prorated, full-year equivalent)
-- - Same event application sequence (termination → promotion → merit → hiring)
-- - Preserved age/tenure progression and band calculations
-- - Maintained employment status and detailed status code logic
-- - Complete eligibility and enrollment state tracking
--
-- **DUCKDB OPTIMIZATIONS:**
-- - Vectorized CASE expressions for band calculations
-- - Batch event processing using ARRAY_AGG and UNNEST
-- - Columnar storage access patterns for large scans
-- - Indexed joins on simulation_year and employee_id
-- - Memory-efficient CTEs with column pruning
