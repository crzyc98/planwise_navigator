{#
  Chronological event stream for all employees in the simulation.

  This model creates a single, time-ordered stream of every event that
  changes an employee's state during the simulation period.

  Event Priority (for same-day ordering):
  - 1: Termination (highest priority - should be processed last)
  - 2: Promotion
  - 3: Merit/Raise
  - 9: Initial State (lowest priority - processed first)

  Each row represents a point-in-time change for an employee.
