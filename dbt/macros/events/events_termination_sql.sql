{% macro events_termination_sql(cohort_table, simulation_year) %}
  {#-
    Generate termination events for E068A fused event generation

    This macro extracts termination event logic from int_termination_events.sql
    and int_new_hire_termination_events.sql and optimizes it for in-memory
    CTE processing within the fused fct_yearly_events model.

    Parameters:
    - cohort_table: CTE name containing cohort data with RNG values
    - simulation_year: Current simulation year

    Returns: SQL for termination events CTE (both experienced and new hire)
