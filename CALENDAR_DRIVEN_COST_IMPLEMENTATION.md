## 1. Configuration Architecture

### 1.1 Event Calendar YAML Configuration

**File**: `config/event_calendar.yaml`
```yaml
# Enterprise Event Calendar Configuration
# Controls timing and sequencing of all workforce events

event_calendar:
  fiscal_year_start: "01-01"

  # Cost of Living Adjustments (Market-based)
  cola_adjustment:
    effective_date: "01-01"    # January 1st
    budget_pool: "inflation_adjustment"
    financial_weight: 1.0      # Full year impact

  # Career Advancement (Separate budget pool)
  promotion_cycle:
    effective_date: "02-01"    # February 1st
    budget_pool: "promotion_pool"
    financial_weight: 0.917    # 11/12 months

  # Performance Merit Increases
  merit_cycle:
    effective_date: "07-15"    # July 15th (mid-year)
    budget_pool: "merit_pool"
    financial_weight: 0.458    # 5.5/12 months

  # Budget Pool Allocations (% of total payroll)
  budget_pools:
    inflation_adjustment: 0.025  # 2.5% COLA
    promotion_pool: 0.008        # 0.8% for promotions
    merit_pool: 0.040           # 4.0% merit budget
```

### 1.2 Enhanced Parameter System

**File**: `dbt/macros/get_event_effective_date.sql`
```sql
{%- macro get_event_effective_date(event_type, simulation_year) -%}
  {%- set calendar_config = {
    'COLA': {'month': 1, 'day': 1},
    'PROMOTION': {'month': 2, 'day': 1},
    'RAISE': {'month': 7, 'day': 15}
  } -%}

  {%- set config = calendar_config[event_type] -%}
  CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-{{ "%02d"|format(config.month) }}-{{ "%02d"|format(config.day) }}' AS DATE)
{%- endmacro -%}
```

---

## 2. Prorated Financial Impact Calculations

### 2.1 Time-Weighted Compensation Model

**File**: `dbt/macros/calculate_prorated_impact.sql`
```sql
{%- macro calculate_prorated_impact(event_date, salary_change, simulation_year) -%}
  -- Calculate the financial impact based on event timing within fiscal year
  WITH event_timing AS (
    SELECT
      {{ event_date }} as event_date,
      CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-12-31' AS DATE) as year_end,
      {{ salary_change }} as salary_change
  ),

  time_calculation AS (
    SELECT
      *,
      -- Days remaining in fiscal year after event
      (year_end - event_date + 1) as days_remaining,
      -- Total days in fiscal year
      (CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-12-31' AS DATE) - CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-01-01' AS DATE) + 1) as total_days_in_year
    FROM event_timing
  )

  SELECT
    salary_change * (days_remaining::DECIMAL / total_days_in_year::DECIMAL) as prorated_impact
  FROM time_calculation
{%- endmacro -%}
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Merit Events Model

```sql
