## Architecture Design

### Single-Threaded Compatibility
- All network operations designed for single-threaded execution
- No parallel processing dependencies
- Memory-efficient operation
- Compatible with work laptop resource constraints

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Configuration file settings
3. Auto-detected system settings
4. Built-in defaults (lowest priority)

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when corporate features unavailable
- Fallback to standard networking when needed
- Comprehensive error classification and reporting
- User-friendly error messages in Streamlit interface

### Security Model
- SSL certificate verification enabled by default
- System authentication preferred over stored credentials
- Secure configuration file permissions
- No sensitive data in logs or diagnostics output

## Testing and Validation

### Network Diagnostics Tool
```bash
# Basic connectivity check
python scripts/network_diagnostics.py --basic

# Full diagnostic suite
python scripts/network_diagnostics.py --full

# Proxy-specific testing
python scripts/network_diagnostics.py --proxy-test

# Certificate validation
python scripts/network_diagnostics.py --cert-check
```

### Integration Testing
- Streamlit dashboard network status display
- DbtRunner with proxy environment
- Navigator orchestrator with corporate settings
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Performance Testing
- Single-threaded execution validation
