# Story S013-02 Implementation Summary

**Story**: Data Cleaning Operation Extraction
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2024-06-24

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created clean_duckdb_data Operation

**Location**: `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py` (lines 129-199)

**Operation Signature**:
```python
@op
def clean_duckdb_data(context: OpExecutionContext, years: List[int]) -> Dict[str, int]:
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Dedicated operation for data cleaning with proper Dagster decorators
- ✅ Handles both single year and multiple year cleaning scenarios
- ✅ Cleans both `fct_yearly_events` and `fct_workforce_snapshot` tables
- ✅ Transaction safety with try/except/finally blocks
- ✅ Graceful error handling that doesn't fail the pipeline
- ✅ Structured return values for observability
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with year range formatting
- ✅ Complete docstring with usage examples

### 2. Extracted Embedded Cleaning Logic

**Removed 4 Embedded Cleaning Patterns**:

1. **Multi-year simulation initial cleaning** (lines 871-886)
   - **Before**: 14 lines of embedded DELETE logic with connection management
   - **After**: 2 lines calling `clean_duckdb_data(context, years_to_clean)`

2. **Single-year simulation events cleaning** (lines 320-330)
   - **Before**: 8 lines of embedded DELETE with connection management
   - **After**: 1 line calling `clean_duckdb_data(context, [year])`

3. **Single-year simulation workforce cleaning** (lines 518-531)
   - **Before**: 13 lines of embedded DELETE with connection management
   - **After**: Eliminated (handled by initial cleaning call)

4. **Multi-year simulation workforce cleaning** (lines 1089-1103)
   - **Before**: 14 lines of embedded DELETE with connection management
   - **After**: Eliminated (handled by initial cleaning call)

### 3. Integration Points

**clean_duckdb_data Usage**:
1. `run_year_simulation` - Single year cleaning: `clean_duckdb_data(context, [year])`
2. `run_multi_year_simulation` - Multi-year cleaning: `clean_duckdb_data(context, years_to_clean)`

**Total calls**: 2 primary usage points replacing 4 embedded patterns

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

#### Before Refactoring:
- **Embedded DELETE patterns**: 4 locations with 49+ lines total
- **Connection management**: Duplicated 4 times with slight variations
- **Error handling**: Inconsistent across different cleaning locations
- **Transaction safety**: Partial implementation across locations
- **Maintenance burden**: Changes required in 4 separate locations

#### After Refactoring:
- **Centralized operation**: Single 70-line operation handling all scenarios
- **Connection management**: Single implementation with proper cleanup
- **Error handling**: Consistent graceful failure that doesn't break pipeline
- **Transaction safety**: Comprehensive try/except/finally in one location
- **Maintenance**: Single location for all data cleaning logic

#### Code Reduction Analysis:
- **Embedded logic removed**: ~49 lines across 4 locations
- **Centralized operation added**: 70 lines (but handles more scenarios)
- **Call sites**: 4-6 lines total for all usage
- **Net effect**: Eliminated duplication, improved maintainability
- **Effective reduction**: 49 lines of scattered logic → 6 lines of calls

### 5. Enhanced Functionality

**Improvements Over Original Logic**:
- ✅ **Handles both tables**: Events AND workforce snapshots in single call
- ✅ **Year range support**: Can clean multiple years in one operation
- ✅ **Return values**: Provides cleanup metrics for observability
- ✅ **Better logging**: Clear year range formatting and operation status
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Continues pipeline even if tables don't exist
- ✅ **Proper operation**: Uses Dagster @op decorator for pipeline integration

### 6. Examples of Transformation

#### Before (Multi-Year Embedded Pattern):
```python
# Clean all data for the simulation years to ensure fresh start
context.log.info(f"Cleaning existing data for years {start_year}-{end_year}")
conn = duckdb.connect(str(DB_PATH))
try:
    for clean_year in range(start_year, end_year + 1):
        conn.execute(
            "DELETE FROM fct_yearly_events WHERE simulation_year = ?", [clean_year]
        )
    context.log.info(
        "Existing events for years %s-%s deleted", start_year, end_year
    )
except Exception as e:
    context.log.warning(f"Error cleaning simulation data: {e}")
finally:
    conn.close()
```

#### After (Centralized Operation):
```python
# Clean all data for the simulation years to ensure fresh start
years_to_clean = list(range(start_year, end_year + 1))
cleaning_results = clean_duckdb_data(context, years_to_clean)
```

**Benefits**:
- 14 lines → 2 lines (86% reduction)
- Handles both events AND workforce snapshots
- Better error handling and logging
- Returns observable metrics
- Single point of maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### ✅ S013-02 Acceptance Criteria Met:

1. **clean_duckdb_data operation implemented**: ✅ Complete with proper signature and functionality
2. **Embedded cleaning logic extracted**: ✅ All 4 patterns removed and centralized
3. **Integration with multi-year simulation**: ✅ Seamlessly integrated with 2 primary call sites
4. **Transaction safety**: ✅ Comprehensive try/except/finally with proper connection cleanup
5. **Error handling**: ✅ Graceful failure that allows pipeline continuation
6. **Return value structure**: ✅ Dict with structured cleanup metrics

### Additional Achievements:
- ✅ **Enhanced functionality**: Handles both tables in single operation
- ✅ **Better observability**: Structured return values and improved logging
- ✅ **Improved testability**: Dedicated operation that can be unit tested
- ✅ **Code quality**: Eliminated duplication and centralized logic

## Foundation for Epic E013

The `clean_duckdb_data` operation provides:
- **Clean separation of concerns**: Data cleaning isolated from orchestration logic
- **Reusable component**: Can be used by future simulation operations
- **Foundation for S013-06**: Enables pure orchestration in multi-year simulation
- **Testing foundation**: Modular operation ready for comprehensive testing in S013-07

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Benefits:
- Eliminated ~49 lines of duplicated embedded logic
- Centralized data cleaning logic in single, maintainable operation
- Improved transaction safety and error handling consistency
- Enhanced observability with structured return values
- Reduced maintenance burden from 4 locations to 1

### Code Quality Metrics:
- **Duplication elimination**: 4 embedded patterns → 1 centralized operation
- **Line reduction**: 49 embedded lines → 6 lines of calls (effective 88% reduction)
- **Error handling**: Inconsistent → standardized graceful failure
- **Transaction safety**: Partial → comprehensive with proper cleanup
- **Testability**: Embedded (untestable) → dedicated operation (fully testable)

## Next Steps for Epic E013:

With S013-01 and S013-02 completed, we have established:
1. ✅ **Centralized dbt command execution** (`execute_dbt_command`)
2. ✅ **Centralized data cleaning** (`clean_duckdb_data`)

**Ready for**:
- **S013-03**: Event Processing Modularization (can leverage both utilities)
- **S013-05**: Single-Year Refactoring (foundation components ready)
- **S013-06**: Multi-Year Orchestration (major simplification now possible)

## Conclusion

Story S013-02 successfully achieved all objectives:
- ✅ Extracted embedded data cleaning logic into dedicated operation
- ✅ Eliminated duplication across 4 locations
- ✅ Improved transaction safety and error handling
- ✅ Enhanced functionality with better observability
- ✅ Established foundation for pure orchestration in multi-year simulation

The data cleaning extraction validates the modularization approach and sets up the pipeline for significant simplification in upcoming stories.
