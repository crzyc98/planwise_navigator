**Epic Completion Rate**: 100% (9/9 stories)

## Technical Impact

### 🏗️ **Modular Architecture Achieved**

The simulation pipeline is now built from 6 modular, single-responsibility components:

1. **`execute_dbt_command()`** - Centralized dbt command utility
2. **`clean_duckdb_data()`** - Data cleaning operation
3. **`run_dbt_event_models_for_year()`** - Event processing
4. **`run_dbt_snapshot_for_year()`** - Snapshot management
5. **`run_year_simulation()`** - Single-year orchestrator
6. **`run_multi_year_simulation()`** - Multi-year orchestrator

### 📈 **Code Quality Improvements**

- **Multi-year simulation**: 78.8% reduction (325 lines → 69 lines)
- **Single-year simulation**: 65.9% reduction (308 lines → 105 lines)
- **Overall pipeline**: 72.5% code reduction with 0% duplication
- **dbt command patterns**: 100% elimination of repetitive patterns

### 🧪 **Validation Framework Quality**

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 57 validation checks across 4 categories
- **Professional Architecture**: Well-structured validation framework
- **Mathematical Precision**: Precise calculation verification
