# Session 2025-07-28: New Hire Status Classification Fix

**Date**: July 28, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: New hire active participants incorrectly classified as "continuous_active" instead of "new_hire_active"

## Problem Description

### Initial Issue
- **Symptom**: New hire participants who were active at year-end but hired during the simulation year were showing `detailed_status_code = 'continuous_active'` in `fct_workforce_snapshot`
- **Expected Behavior**: These employees should have `detailed_status_code = 'new_hire_active'` until the simulation year **after** their hire year
- **Business Impact**: Incorrect cost attribution for new hire vs. experienced employee cohorts in workforce modeling

### Root Cause Analysis
Using specialized Claude Code subagents (`cost-modeling-architect`, `data-quality-auditor`, `duckdb-dbt-optimizer`), we identified:

1. **Primary Issue**: Deduplication logic in `unioned_workforce_raw` CTE was prioritizing existing workforce records over new hire records
2. **Secondary Issue**: Missing proper hire date preservation during record merging
3. **Data Pipeline**: The issue was in the `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` model's record prioritization logic

## Technical Investigation

### Agent Analysis Results

#### Cost-Modeling-Architect
- Identified that temporal accuracy was compromised in event sourcing architecture
- Recommended hire year vs. simulation year comparison instead of event-based classification
- Emphasized importance for accurate DC plan participant categorization

#### Data-Quality-Auditor
- Found 100% misclassification rate for new hire participants
- Discovered that 658 employees hired in 2025 were incorrectly marked as "continuous_active"
- Identified that `int_employees_with_initial_state` table was empty, indicating pipeline issues

#### DuckDB-DBT-Optimizer
- Analyzed deduplication performance and identified inefficient record prioritization
- Recommended optimized `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)` operations for date comparisons
- Designed efficient window function approach for record deduplication

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Deduplication Logic
**File**: `/Users/nicholasamaral/planwise_navigator/dbt/models/marts/fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`
**Lines**: 223-229

```sql
-- OPTIMIZATION: Prioritize new_hire records for employees hired this year
-- This ensures correct hire dates are preserved for status classification
CASE
    WHEN record_source = 'new_hire' AND
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM employee_hire_date) = {{ simulation_year }}
    THEN 1
    WHEN record_source = 'existing' THEN 2
    ELSE 3
END
```

### 2. Enhanced Status Classification Logic
**File**: Same as above
**Lines**: 481-495

```sql
-- **FIX 1**: Enhanced detailed_status_code logic to handle all edge cases
CASE
    -- Active new hires (hired in current year, still active)
    WHEN fwc.employment_status = 'active' AND
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fwc.employee_hire_date) = sp.current_year
    THEN 'new_hire_active'

    -- Terminated new hires (hired and terminated in current year)
    WHEN fwc.employment_status = 'terminated' AND
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fwc.employee_hire_date) = sp.current_year
    THEN 'new_hire_termination'

    -- Active existing employees (hired before current year, still active)
    WHEN fwc.employment_status = 'active' AND
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fwc.employee_hire_date) < sp.current_year
    THEN 'continuous_active'

    -- Terminated existing employees
    WHEN fwc.employment_status = 'terminated' AND
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fwc.employee_hire_date) < sp.current_year
    THEN 'experienced_termination'

    -- Safety fallbacks
    WHEN fwc.employee_hire_date IS NULL
    THEN 'continuous_active'  -- Default for NULL hire date

    ELSE 'continuous_active'
END AS detailed_status_code
```

### 3. Created Validation Test
**File**: `/Users/nicholasamaral/planwise_navigator/tests/validation/test_new_hire_status_classification.sql`

- Comprehensive validation logic for all status code combinations
- Checks hire year vs simulation year consistency
- Provides detailed error reporting and summary statistics
- Ensures ongoing data quality monitoring

## Results

### Before Fix
- **New Hire Active**: 0 employees ❌
- **Continuous Active**: 4,512 employees (included 658 misclassified new hires)
- **Misclassification Rate**: 100% of new hires

### After Fix
- **New Hire Active**: 658 employees ✅ (correctly classified)
- **Continuous Active**: 3,854 employees ✅ (correctly classified)
- **New Hire Termination**: 219 employees ✅
- **Experienced Termination**: 524 employees ✅
- **Misclassification Rate**: 0% ✅

### Performance Impact
- **Query Execution Time**: 0.0053s (very fast)
- **DuckDB Optimization**: Efficient `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)` operations
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact due to optimized window functions

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Event Sourcing Complexity**: Deduplication logic in event-sourced systems requires careful record prioritization
2. **Temporal Data Integrity**: Hire dates are immutable anchors that should be preserved through transformations
3. **DuckDB Performance**: Native date functions are highly optimized for analytical workloads

### Process Improvements
1. **Multi-Agent Analysis**: Using specialized subagents provided comprehensive root cause analysis
2. **Validation Framework**: Proactive test creation prevents future regressions
3. **Documentation**: Clear session logging helps track complex multi-step fixes

### Business Value
1. **Cost Attribution Accuracy**: Proper classification enables accurate new hire vs. experienced employee cost modeling
2. **DC Plan Compliance**: Correct participant categorization for regulatory reporting
3. **Workforce Analytics**: Enhanced accuracy in headcount and retention analysis
