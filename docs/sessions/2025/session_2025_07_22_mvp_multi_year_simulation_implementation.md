# MVP Orchestrator Multi-Year Simulation Implementation
**Session Date:** July 22, 2025
**Session Type:** Feature Implementation
**Epic:** MVP Orchestrator Enhancement
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive multi-year simulation capabilities for the MVP orchestrator, extending it from single-year debugging to full multi-year workforce simulation (e.g., 2025-2029). The implementation builds incrementally on existing components while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Implementation Approach

### Analysis Phase
- Examined current MVP orchestrator structure in `orchestrator_mvp/`
- Analyzed existing multi-year configuration in `config/test_config.yaml`
- Reviewed dbt models with conditional year logic and year transition handling
- Studied workforce calculation utilities that are already year-aware
- Examined main Dagster orchestrator patterns for proven multi-year approaches

### Design Principles
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing single-year components rather than replacing them
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing single-year debugging workflow unchanged
- **Configuration-Driven**: Use existing `config/test_config.yaml` for multi-year settings
- **Year-Aware Architecture**: All components understand simulation years and transitions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Include year-over-year comparisons and growth validation

    loop For each year (2025-2029)

    MultiYear->>Inspector: validate_cumulative_growth(2025, 2029, target_rate)

    Inspector-->>User: Multi-year simulation results and analysis
```

### Year Transition Logic
- **Year 1 (2025)**: Uses `int_baseline_workforce` table
- **Subsequent Years**: Uses previous year's `fct_workforce_snapshot` where `employment_status = 'active'`
- **Validation**: Ensures proper employee age/tenure progression and data continuity
- **Fallback**: If previous year data missing, falls back to baseline workforce

### Configuration Integration
Uses existing `config/test_config.yaml`:
```yaml
simulation:
  start_year: 2025
  end_year: 2029
  random_seed: 42
  target_growth_rate: 0.03

workforce:
  total_termination_rate: 0.12
  new_hire_termination_rate: 0.25
```

## Usage Examples

### Single-Year Mode (Unchanged)
```bash
# Interactive debugging
python orchestrator_mvp/run_mvp.py

# Non-interactive
python orchestrator_mvp/run_mvp.py --no-breaks
```

### Multi-Year Simulation (New)
```bash
# Interactive multi-year simulation
python orchestrator_mvp/run_mvp.py --multi-year

# Non-interactive multi-year simulation
python orchestrator_mvp/run_mvp.py --multi-year --no-breaks
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from orchestrator_mvp import (
    run_multi_year_simulation,
    compare_year_over_year_metrics,
    validate_cumulative_growth,
    display_multi_year_summary
)

# Run multi-year simulation
config = {
    'target_growth_rate': 0.03,
    'workforce': {
        'total_termination_rate': 0.12,
        'new_hire_termination_rate': 0.25
    },
    'random_seed': 42
}

results = run_multi_year_simulation(2025, 2029, config, skip_breaks=True)

# Analyze results
compare_year_over_year_metrics(2025, 2029)
validate_cumulative_growth(2025, 2029, 0.03)
display_multi_year_summary(2025, 2029)
```
