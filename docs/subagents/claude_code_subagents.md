# Example 2: Performance optimization
"Our dbt models are running slowly on large datasets. Use the duckdb-dbt-optimizer agent to analyze and optimize our transformations."

# Example 3: Pipeline orchestration
"Set up a Prefect workflow that processes employee events in the correct order. Use the prefect-orchestration-engineer agent."

# Example 4: Data validation
"Implement comprehensive data quality checks for our event sourcing system. Use the data-quality-auditor agent."

## Best Practices

1. **Use "ultrathink" keyword** when you need deeper analysis from any agent
2. **Run agents in parallel** for complex tasks: "Deploy 3 agents in parallel to handle architecture, optimization, and validation"
3. **Combine agents** for comprehensive solutions: "Use cost-modeling-architect and data-quality-auditor together"
4. **Leverage separate context windows** - each agent maintains its own context for focused work
