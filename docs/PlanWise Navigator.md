# **PlanWise Navigator**

Imagine a system that meticulously captures every key event in your workforce—from the first day someone is hired, through every pay increase, benefit enrollment, and retirement-plan change—and permanently records it in an immutable "event log." Now imagine having the ability to replay this detailed history at any moment, clearly visualizing exactly how your headcount, payroll expenses, and retirement plan participation evolved year by year.

That's exactly what we've built:

**1. Enterprise-Grade Audit Trail**

Every workforce event—new hires, terminations, promotions, salary adjustments, benefit enrollments, and plan changes—is uniquely stamped with a UUID and precise timestamp, forming a secure, tamper-proof historical record of your entire employee population.

**2. Modular and Flexible Engines**

Each business rule—compensation adjustments, voluntary enrollments, automatic escalations, proactive contributions—is encapsulated into its own configurable engine. Need to explore alternative policies or tweak existing scenarios? Simply adjust parameters in a straightforward YAML file, rerun the simulation, and instantly visualize the impact—no programming required.

**3. On-Demand Snapshots and Scenario Analysis**

Curious about your workforce metrics as of a specific date in the future, like June 30, 2027? Effortlessly reconstruct precise workforce states directly from the event log. Want to assess the financial impact of a more aggressive employer match policy or higher retention rates? Change the settings, quickly rerun forecasts, and compare multiple scenarios in seconds.

**4. Analyst-Friendly Configuration**

All essential assumptions—including turnover rates, compensation growth, enrollment timing, and employer match configurations—are managed through clearly structured, human-readable CSV and YAML files. Finance and HR teams can easily refine forecasts and strategies without ever touching the underlying Python code.

**5. End-to-End Transparency and Reproducibility**

From raw workforce events to aggregated metrics such as headcount, participation rates, and total compensation costs, every step is fully documented, thoroughly tested, and reproducible. This transparency is invaluable for auditors, regulators, and organizational leaders, providing clarity and confidence in every result.

In short, we've transitioned from rigid, error-prone spreadsheets to a dynamic, robust, and fully transparent simulation engine. Think of it as upgrading from a black-box spreadsheet to a fully auditable workforce "time machine," empowering analysts and executives alike to confidently explore past trends, understand current dynamics, and strategically plan future scenarios.

**Technical Addendum (Advanced Capabilities):**

**1. Immutable Event Sourcing:**

- Each event (hire, termination, salary change, benefit enrollment, contribution change) is immutably recorded with a universally unique identifier (UUID) and high-precision timestamps.
- The event log ensures historical accuracy, auditability, and reproducibility of workforce states and transitions.

**2. Modular Event-Driven Architecture:**

- Decoupled business-rule engines (compensation, terminations, hiring, promotions, plan participation) communicate exclusively through clearly defined event logs, eliminating hidden side effects and increasing robustness.
- Each module (engine) independently manages logic with clearly scoped responsibilities, making it straightforward to introduce new rules, policies, or workforce behaviors.

**3. Dynamic Snapshot Reconstruction:**

- Workforce states at any given date can be quickly reconstructed from logged events, enabling historical audits, regulatory compliance reviews, and scenario validation.
- Snapshots are strictly validated against predefined schemas, ensuring data integrity and preventing drift or data inconsistencies.

**4. Advanced Compensation Modeling:**

- Highly configurable compensation engines support multiple raise methodologies (COLA, promotion-driven, merit-based distributions).
- Compensation parameters (mean, standard deviation, promotion probabilities, and band-specific rules) can be fine-tuned via YAML, facilitating sophisticated modeling tailored to specific organizational policies.

**5. Intelligent New-Hire Sampling:**

- Band-aware salary sampling mechanisms ensure realistic compensation distributions aligned with internal pay scales and external market benchmarks.
- Age distributions, tenure profiles, and salary progression assumptions are intelligently generated, mimicking real-world workforce demographics and compensation patterns.

**6. Parameterized Hazard Modeling:**

- Hazard tables capture turnover probabilities, segmented by roles and tenure bands, enabling nuanced modeling of attrition dynamics.
- Extensive hazard-model configurability allows scenario exploration (e.g., retention programs, turnover shocks) and immediate impact visualization.

**7. Robust Scenario Management:**

- The system supports effortless switching between multiple workforce scenarios (baseline, aggressive growth, cost containment), each defined through clear, human-readable configuration files.
- Analysts can perform extensive "what-if" scenario analyses rapidly, enabling strategic planning, sensitivity testing, and policy optimization.

**8. Comprehensive Testing and Continuous Integration:**

- An extensive automated test suite (unit, integration, and smoke tests) ensures reliability, detects regressions, and facilitates rapid development iterations.
- Continuous integration workflows validate each component’s functionality, enforcing code quality, schema compliance, and data integrity.

In essence, this advanced approach represents a major leap forward in workforce modeling capability, accuracy, and agility, providing stakeholders with unparalleled insights and strategic decision-making power.
