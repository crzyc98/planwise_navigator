# PlanAlign Studio - Business Overview

## What is PlanAlign Studio?

**PlanAlign Studio** is a workforce planning and simulation platform that helps organizations forecast their future workforce needs, costs, and retirement benefit obligations. Think of it as a "time machine" for your workforce—it allows you to see what your employee population will look like years into the future and test different strategic scenarios before committing to them.

## The Problem We Solve

### Traditional Workforce Planning Challenges

Most organizations rely on spreadsheets for workforce planning. While familiar, spreadsheets create serious business risks:

**1. Lost Work and Broken Formulas**
- One accidental keystroke can break months of work
- No way to undo changes made weeks ago
- Formulas mysteriously stop working and nobody knows why

**2. Inconsistent Results**
- Different analysts get different answers from the same data
- No way to reproduce last quarter's forecast
- Impossible to verify someone else's calculations

**3. No Audit Trail**
- Can't see who changed what or when
- No record of assumptions or decisions
- Compliance and regulatory review nightmares

**4. Manual and Time-Consuming**
- Takes days or weeks to run "what-if" scenarios
- Each scenario requires copying entire spreadsheets
- Easy to lose track of which version is current

**5. Limited Scale**
- Performance grinds to a halt with 10,000+ employees
- Can only model 3-5 years before spreadsheet crashes
- Complex scenarios become impossible to manage

## The Solution

### What PlanAlign Studio Does

PlanAlign Studio replaces fragile spreadsheets with a robust simulation platform that:

**Automatically Projects Your Workforce**
- Forecasts hiring needs based on growth targets
- Predicts employee turnover using statistical models
- Projects promotions and compensation changes
- Calculates retirement plan costs and obligations

**Compares Multiple Scenarios Side-by-Side**
- "What if we grow 5% vs. 10%?"
- "What if turnover increases by 20%?"
- "What if we freeze hiring for 6 months?"
- Run unlimited scenarios and compare results instantly

**Creates a Complete Audit Trail**
- Every assumption and calculation is permanently recorded
- See exactly what changed between forecast versions
- Reproduce any previous forecast identically
- Meet regulatory compliance requirements automatically

**Enables Self-Service Analytics**
- Interactive dashboards for exploring results
- Export to Excel for presentations and reports
- No programming or technical skills required
- Immediate answers to "what-if" questions

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. Start with Your Current Workforce
You provide a census of your current employees (export from your HR system):
- Employee ID
- Hire date
- Department
- Job level
- Current salary
- Retirement plan enrollment

### 2. Set Your Planning Assumptions
Configure your forecast parameters through simple settings:
- **Growth Rate**: "We plan to grow headcount by 5% annually"
- **Turnover Rate**: "We expect 12% of employees to leave each year"
- **Salary Increases**: "3% cost-of-living adjustment plus merit raises"
- **Promotion Rate**: "8% of employees get promoted annually"

### 3. Run the Simulation
Click "Run Simulation" and PlanAlign Studio:
- Projects workforce changes year by year
- Records every hire, termination, promotion, and raise as a separate event
- Calculates retirement plan contributions and costs
- Builds point-in-time snapshots of your workforce

### 4. Explore the Results
Use interactive dashboards to:
- View headcount trends over time
- Analyze compensation costs by department
- Project retirement plan obligations
- Export detailed reports to Excel

### 5. Test Alternative Scenarios
Create variations to answer strategic questions:
- **Baseline**: Current growth plan (5% annually)
- **High Growth**: Aggressive expansion (10% annually)
- **Cost Control**: Hiring freeze + attrition only
- **Retention Focus**: Reduced turnover through retention programs

Compare all scenarios side-by-side to make informed decisions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be a programmer to use this?**
A: No. If you can work with Excel and understand workforce planning concepts, you can use PlanAlign Studio. Configuration is done through simple YAML files (similar to filling out a form), and dashboards are point-and-click.

**Q: How long does it take to run a simulation?**
A: A 5-year forecast for 10,000 employees runs in about 2-3 minutes. Larger workforces (50,000+) take 5-10 minutes.

**Q: Can I export results to Excel?**
A: Yes. PlanAlign Studio can export comprehensive Excel workbooks with multiple sheets showing workforce snapshots, metrics, event summaries, and configuration details.

**Q: What if I want to change my assumptions?**
A: Simply update the configuration file and re-run the simulation. You can keep multiple configurations for different scenarios and run them in parallel.

**Q: How does it handle retirement plan calculations?**
A: PlanAlign Studio models employee and employer contributions, vesting schedules, enrollment eligibility, and highly compensated employee (HCE) determination. It supports complex plan designs with configurable formulas.

**Q: Is this a cloud service?**
A: No. PlanAlign Studio runs entirely on your own servers or workstations. No data leaves your organization.

**Q: What happens if the simulation fails partway through?**
A: PlanAlign Studio saves checkpoints automatically. You can resume from the last successful checkpoint without starting over.

**Q: Can multiple people use it at the same time?**
A: Yes. Each user can work on their own scenarios independently. The dashboard supports 10+ concurrent users.

**Q: How do I know the results are correct?**
A: PlanAlign Studio includes extensive validation rules that check for mathematical consistency, impossible scenarios, and unexpected patterns. You can also export complete event logs to verify every calculation.

**Q: What kind of training is required?**
A: Most workforce planners are productive within 1-2 days. The learning curve is similar to learning a new reporting tool—much easier than learning programming or database administration.
