# Story S055: Audit Current Raise Timing Implementation

**Story ID**: S055
**Story Name**: Audit Current Raise Timing Implementation
**Epic**: E012 - Compensation System Integrity Fix (Phase 3)
**Story Points**: 2
**Priority**: Must Have
**Sprint**: TBD
**Status**: Complete
**Assigned To**: Engineering Team
**Business Owner**: Analytics Team

## Problem Statement

All employee raises in the workforce simulation currently occur on January 1st, creating unrealistic compensation patterns that don't reflect real-world business practices. This makes prorated annual compensation calculations meaningless and reduces the credibility of simulation outputs for workforce planning.

### Current State Issues
- **Unrealistic Timing**: 100% of raises on January 1st vs. real companies that spread raises throughout the year
- **Meaningless Prorating**: Mid-year compensation adjustments not properly reflected
- **Analytics Distortion**: Compensation growth patterns don't match business cycles
- **Audit Concerns**: Unrealistic patterns undermine simulation credibility

## User Story

**As a** workforce analytics team member
**I want** to understand exactly how raise events are currently generated and timed
**So that** I can design a realistic raise timing system that matches actual business practices

## Technical Scope

### Research Areas

1. **RAISE Event Generation Logic**
   - Locate where RAISE events are created in the codebase
   - Understand current date assignment mechanism
   - Identify hard-coded January 1st references

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Map RAISE event flow from generation to final tables
   - Identify all models that process raise events
   - Document current prorated compensation calculations

3. **Configuration Review**
   - Examine raise-related parameters in `simulation_config.yaml`
   - Review any raise timing configurations
   - Identify hard-coded values vs. configurable parameters

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - Count current raise events and their distribution
   - Analyze compensation calculations affected by timing
   - Document downstream effects on analytics

### Files to Investigate

**Primary Focus Areas**:
- `orchestrator/` - Dagster pipeline logic for raise events
- `dbt/models/intermediate/events/` - Event processing models
- `dbt/models/marts/` - Final compensation calculations
- `config/simulation_config.yaml` - Raise configuration parameters

**Expected Key Files**:
- RAISE event generation logic (Python/SQL)
- Compensation calculation models
- Prorated compensation logic
- Event processing workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Deliverables

1. **Current Implementation Analysis**
   - [ ] Document exact location of RAISE event generation logic
   - [ ] Identify all hard-coded January 1st date assignments
   - [ ] Map complete data flow from RAISE events to final calculations
   - [ ] List all configuration parameters related to raises

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] Count total RAISE events in current simulation
   - [ ] Confirm 100% occur on January 1st (validate the problem)
   - [ ] Identify all models/calculations affected by timing
   - [ ] Document prorated compensation calculation accuracy issues

3. **Technical Architecture Documentation**
   - [ ] Create data flow diagram for RAISE event processing
   - [ ] Document current vs. desired raise timing patterns
   - [ ] Identify integration points for new timing logic
   - [ ] List all files requiring modification for timing fix

4. **Business Pattern Research**
   - [ ] Research realistic corporate raise timing patterns
   - [ ] Define target distribution percentages by business cycle
   - [ ] Document industry best practices for raise timing
   - [ ] Validate proposed timing patterns with business stakeholders

### Validation Requirements

1. **Current State Verification**
   - Query simulation database to confirm all raises on Jan 1st
   - Validate prorated compensation calculations are using incorrect timing
   - Confirm impact on year-over-year growth calculations

2. **Scope Boundary Definition**
   - Identify what changes vs. what stays the same
   - Define interaction with promotion events (separate timing)
   - Clarify relationship with COLA and merit increase logic

## Research Questions to Answer

### Technical Questions
1. Where exactly are RAISE events generated in the codebase?
2. How are raise amounts calculated vs. raise timing determined?
3. What is the current relationship between raise events and prorated compensation?
4. Are there any existing timing variations or is it 100% January 1st?

### Business Questions
1. What realistic raise timing patterns should we implement?
2. How do raises interact with promotion timing and other events?
3. What prorated compensation accuracy improvements are expected?
4. How will this change affect existing compensation growth calibration?

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete technical audit documented with file locations and line numbers
- [ ] Current raise timing confirmed as 100% January 1st with evidence
- [ ] Data flow diagram created showing RAISE event processing
- [ ] Business requirements defined for realistic timing patterns
- [ ] Impact assessment completed for all affected calculations
- [ ] Technical implementation approach outlined for next stories
- [ ] Stakeholder review completed and feedback incorporated

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Access to simulation database and codebase
- Understanding of current compensation system (from E012 Phase 1 & 2)
- Business stakeholder availability for timing pattern validation

### Blocks Next Stories
- **S056**: Design realistic raise timing system (depends on this audit)
- **S057**: Implement raise date generation logic (needs architecture from this story)

## Business Impact

**Impact**: Medium - Foundation for realistic compensation simulation
**Risk**: Low - Research and documentation only, no code changes
**Value**: High - Enables accurate workforce planning and audit compliance

## Success Metrics

- **Technical Understanding**: Complete documentation of current implementation
- **Problem Validation**: Confirmed evidence of January 1st clustering issue
- **Solution Foundation**: Clear path forward for realistic timing implementation
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Business approval of proposed timing patterns
