# S020-01: Polars Performance Proof of Concept

**Epic:** E020 - Polars Integration Layer
**Story Points:** 1 (XS - 1 hour)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-10)
**Assignee:** Developer
**Start Date:** Today
**Target Date:** Today

## Business Value

Validate Polars performance gains on existing workforce simulation data to establish business case for broader adoption, enabling faster analyst workflows and reduced computation times.

**User Story:**
As a data engineer, I want to demonstrate Polars performance gains on existing workforce data so that we can validate the business case for broader Polars adoption and faster simulation runs.

## Technical Approach

Create a standalone benchmark script that leverages existing DuckDB infrastructure to compare pandas vs Polars performance on real workforce data operations. Zero impact to existing codebase - purely additive proof-of-concept.

## Implementation Details

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage

**DuckDB Connection Patterns:**
- Use existing `DuckDBResource` from `/orchestrator/resources/duckdb_resource.py`
- Leverage established DataFrame conversion: `conn.execute().df()`
- Test against populated `fct_workforce_snapshot` table

**Benchmark Infrastructure:**
- Build on existing patterns from `/tests/perf/benchmark_runtime.py`
- Use existing `psutil` integration for memory monitoring
- Follow established performance measurement conventions

**Data Sources:**
- `fct_workforce_snapshot` (existing, populated with simulation data)
- Current 100k employee dataset from recent simulation runs

### New Components to Create

**Benchmark Script:**
```python
# /scripts/polars_benchmark_poc.py
# Standalone performance comparison script
# - Load data via DuckDB
# - Run identical operations in pandas vs Polars
# - Measure execution time and memory usage
# - Generate performance report
```

**Target Operations to Benchmark:**
1. **Filtering** active employees (`employment_status == 'active'`)
2. **Grouping** by job level and calculating statistics
3. **Aggregations** compensation statistics (mean, median, percentiles)
4. **Memory usage** comparison for DataFrame operations

## Dependencies

**Existing Infrastructure (Available):**
- DuckDB database with `fct_workforce_snapshot` data
- Established DuckDB connection patterns
- Virtual environment with pandas, psutil
- Benchmark infrastructure patterns

**New Dependencies (To Install):**
- `polars>=0.20.0` (MIT license, compatible)

**External Dependencies:** None

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Tests
- Verify pandas and Polars operations produce identical results
- Confirm memory usage is tracked accurately
- Validate benchmark timing measurements

### Performance Tests
- Execute benchmark on existing 100k employee dataset
- Measure execution time for each operation type
- Track memory usage during DataFrame operations

### Safety Tests
- Confirm no impact to existing virtual environment
- Verify DuckDB connections work with new dependency
- Test script runs without affecting simulation database

## Implementation Steps

**Phase 1: Setup (5 minutes)**
1. Install Polars dependency: `pip install polars`
2. Verify installation and imports

**Phase 2: Benchmark Script (30 minutes)**
3. Create `/scripts/polars_benchmark_poc.py`
4. Implement DuckDB data loading
5. Add pandas operations (filtering, grouping, aggregation)
6. Add equivalent Polars operations
7. Include timing and memory measurement

**Phase 3: Testing (15 minutes)**
8. Run benchmark on existing workforce data
9. Verify identical results between pandas/Polars
10. Capture performance metrics

**Phase 4: Documentation (10 minutes)**
11. Generate performance report
12. Document findings in CLAUDE.md memory section
13. Create summary of results and recommendations

## Rollback Plan

**If Issues Arise:**
1. **Dependency conflicts:** Remove Polars with `pip uninstall polars`
2. **Performance issues:** Script is standalone - no impact to existing code
3. **Data access issues:** Use existing DuckDB patterns - no new connections

**Zero Risk Profile:**
- No changes to existing simulation codebase
- Standalone script with no side effects
- Easy removal if unsuccessful

## Success Metrics

**Performance Success:**
- Polars operations 2x+ faster than pandas equivalents
- Memory usage comparable or better than pandas
- Clear performance improvement demonstrated

**Technical Success:**
- All operations produce identical results
- Script completes without errors
- No conflicts with existing dependencies

**Business Success:**
- Clear performance report with concrete metrics
- Business case established for broader Polars adoption
- Foundation for future Polars integration stories
