# Create cost attributor
attributor = create_cost_attributor(
    scenario_id="scenario_123",
    plan_design_id="plan_456",
    allocation_strategy=AllocationStrategy.PRO_RATA_TEMPORAL
)

# Create allocation context
context = create_allocation_context(
    source_year=2024,
    target_years=[2025, 2026, 2027],
    source_workforce_metrics=source_metrics,
    target_workforce_metrics=target_metrics_dict,
    source_events=compensation_events
)

# Perform attribution
attribution_entries = attributor.attribute_compensation_costs_across_years(context)
```

### Cache Management
```python
from orchestrator_mvp.core.intelligent_cache import create_cache_manager

# Create cache manager
cache_manager = create_cache_manager(
    l1_max_entries=1000,
    l2_max_entries=5000,
    l3_max_entries=20000,
    enable_optimization=True
)

# Cache and retrieve data
cache_manager.put("workforce_2024", workforce_data, CacheEntryType.WORKFORCE_STATE)
cached_data = cache_manager.get("workforce_2024", CacheEntryType.WORKFORCE_STATE)
```

### Coordination Optimization
```python
from orchestrator_mvp.core.coordination_optimizer import create_coordination_optimizer

# Create optimizer
optimizer = create_coordination_optimizer(
    strategy=OptimizationStrategy.BALANCED,
    target_reduction_percent=Decimal('65'),
    cache_manager=cache_manager
)

# Optimize multi-year coordination
results = optimizer.optimize_multi_year_coordination(
    state_manager=state_manager,
