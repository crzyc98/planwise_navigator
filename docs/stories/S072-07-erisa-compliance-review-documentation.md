# Story S072-07: ERISA Compliance Review & Documentation

**Epic**: E021-A - DC Plan Event Schema Foundation
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: S072-06 (Completed)
**Completion Date**: 2025-07-14

## 1\. Story Definition

**As a** compliance officer,
**I want** comprehensive ERISA compliance validation and documentation for the event schema
**So that** we meet all fiduciary requirements and can pass regulatory audits with complete confidence.

## 2\. Core Objectives & Acceptance Criteria

### ERISA Compliance Validation

  - [ ] **Benefits Counsel Review**: A qualified ERISA attorney completes a review and signs the approval checklist.
  - [ ] **Fiduciary Compliance**: All administrative event types are verified for fiduciary compliance.
  - [ ] **Audit Trail Coverage**: The event schema provides a complete audit trail to ensure participant protection.
  - [ ] **DOL Reporting**: The event schema's design addresses all Department of Labor (DOL) reporting requirements.

### Regulatory & Security Coverage

  - [ ] **IRS & ERISA Codes**: Events are correctly categorized for IRS (402(g), 415(c)) and ERISA (404(c)) compliance.
  - [ ] **Data Retention**: Data retention policies for the 7-year ERISA requirement are established.
  - [ ] **PII Classification**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is classified, with SSN as "RESTRICTED" and compensation as "CONFIDENTIAL".
  - [ ] **Security Standards**: Data encryption and role-based access controls are documented and verified.

### Audit Readiness & Documentation

  - [ ] **Compliance Documentation**: A complete compliance document with regulatory references is created.
  - [ ] **Audit Procedures**: Procedures for responding to DOL inquiries using the event audit trail are documented.
  - [ ] **Breach Response**: Procedures for handling compliance violations are documented.

## 4\. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Validation

  - [ ] **Map Requirements**: Map all event types to the specific ERISA sections they cover.
  - [ ] **Analyze Gaps**: Identify and document any gaps in compliance.

  - [ ] **Present Schema**: Present the event schema design and compliance analysis to counsel.
  - [ ] **Incorporate Feedback**: Address all feedback from counsel and implement required changes.
  - [ ] **Obtain Sign-off**: Secure a signed compliance approval, documenting any conditions.

### Phase 3: Documentation and Procedure Development

  - [ ] **Create Compliance Guide**: Develop a comprehensive guide with all regulatory references.
  - [ ] **Document Audit Procedures**: Create formal procedures for using the audit trail to respond to DOL inquiries.
  - [ ] **Establish Policies**: Finalize and document data retention and breach response policies.

## 5\. Dependencies

  * **Story S072-06**: Requires the completed Performance & Validation Framework.
  * **External**: Dependent on the availability of a qualified ERISA attorney for benefits counsel review.
