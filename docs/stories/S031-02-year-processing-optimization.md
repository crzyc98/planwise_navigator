### Architecture Considerations

- Preserve sequential dependencies between years
- Maintain all existing financial precision and audit trails

### DuckDB-Specific Optimizations

#### Columnar Storage Advantages
- **Workforce Tables**: Store employee records in columnar format for efficient analytical queries
- **Event Tables**: Optimize event storage with compression for timestamp and categorical columns
- **Financial Data**: Use decimal precision with columnar compression for compensation calculations

#### Query Optimization Techniques
- **Window Functions**: Optimize employee tenure and ranking calculations using DuckDB's vectorized window functions
- **Aggregations**: Use SIMD-accelerated aggregations for payroll summaries and event rollups
- **Joins**: Leverage hash joins for employee-event associations with proper key ordering
- **Filtering**: Push-down predicates for date ranges and employee status filters

#### Memory Management
- **Streaming Operations**: Use streaming aggregations for large workforce datasets
- **Batch Processing**: Process events in 10,000-record batches to control memory usage
- **Result Caching**: Cache intermediate results for repeated calculations within year processing

### dbt Batch Execution Strategy

#### Model Dependency Grouping
```yaml
# Execution Groups for Parallel Processing
Group 1 (Staging - Parallel):
  - stg_census_data
  - stg_compensation_parameters
  - stg_benefit_plans

Group 2 (Intermediate - Parallel):
  - int_baseline_workforce
  - int_effective_parameters
  - int_plan_eligibility

Group 3 (Event Generation - Sequential):
  - int_termination_events
  - int_hiring_events
  - int_promotion_events
  - int_compensation_events

Group 4 (Aggregation - Parallel):
  - int_yearly_event_summary
  - int_workforce_metrics

Group 5 (Final Output - Sequential):
  - fct_yearly_events
  - fct_workforce_snapshot
```

#### Resource Allocation
- **Memory per Model**: Allocate 1-2GB per model for large transformations
- **Thread Pool**: Use 3-4 threads for parallel model execution
- **Connection Pool**: Maintain 2 DuckDB connections per thread to avoid contention

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Model Timing**: Track execution time for each model group
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor peak memory consumption per model
- **Query Plans**: Analyze DuckDB query execution plans for optimization opportunities

### Analytical Workload Optimization

#### Event Generation Performance
```sql
-- Optimized batch event insertion
INSERT INTO fct_yearly_events
SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as event_id,
    employee_id,
    event_type,
    effective_date,
    event_payload
FROM (
    -- Use VALUES clause for batch processing
    SELECT * FROM generate_events_batch(10000)
) events;
```

#### Snapshot Calculation Optimization
```sql
-- Materialized view for workforce snapshots
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW workforce_snapshot_mv AS
SELECT
    simulation_year,
    employee_id,
    -- Use window functions for running totals
    SUM(salary_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY employee_id
        ORDER BY effective_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as cumulative_compensation
FROM workforce_events
WHERE event_type IN ('HIRE', 'PROMOTION', 'RAISE');
```

#### Financial Modeling Enhancements
- **Pre-computed Aggregates**: Create summary tables for common financial calculations
- **Incremental Updates**: Use dbt incremental models for large financial datasets
- **Vectorized Calculations**: Leverage DuckDB's SIMD operations for compensation formulas
