- **Efficiency Improvements**: Incremental processing reduces per-year overhead

## System Limitations and Bottlenecks

### Identified Bottlenecks

#### 1. Memory-Bound Scaling
**Issue**: Memory usage grows significantly with dataset size and simulation years
**Impact**: Limits maximum dataset size for given hardware configuration
**Mitigation**:
- Use appropriate optimization level for hardware
- Enable state compression between years
- Consider batch processing for very large datasets

#### 2. Single-Threaded CPU Utilization
**Issue**: Single-core processing limits overall throughput
**Impact**: Longer execution times compared to parallel execution
**Trade-off**: Stability and memory efficiency vs raw performance
**Recommendation**: Accept longer execution times for reliability on constrained hardware

#### 3. Database Size Growth
**Issue**: DuckDB file size grows with simulation years and employee count
**Impact**: Disk space requirements and I/O performance
**Observed Growth**:
- 100K employees: ~500MB per simulation year
- 250K employees: ~1.2GB per simulation year
**Mitigation**: Periodic database optimization and cleanup of intermediate tables

#### 4. State Accumulation Complexity
**Issue**: Complex state accumulation across multiple years increases processing time
**Impact**: Non-linear time growth for very long simulations (10+ years)
**Observed**: Time per year increases by 5-10% for each additional year
**Recommendation**: Limit routine simulations to 5-7 years for optimal performance

### Hard Limits and Constraints

#### Memory Limits
- **Absolute Maximum**: Cannot exceed configured memory limit without crashes
- **Practical Maximum**: Recommend staying within 80% of memory limit for stability
- **Growth Pattern**: Memory needs grow approximately linearly with employee count

#### Dataset Size Limits
- **Low Optimization**: Practical limit ~75K employees for multi-year simulations
- **Medium Optimization**: Practical limit ~150K employees for multi-year simulations
- **High Optimization**: Practical limit ~350K employees for multi-year simulations
- **Single Year Only**: Can handle larger datasets if only simulating one year

#### Simulation Year Limits
- **Standard Workloads**: 5-7 years recommended for routine use
- **Extended Analysis**: Up to 10 years validated for special analysis
- **Performance Degradation**: Time per year increases ~5-10% for each additional year
- **Memory Constraints**: Memory growth may limit long simulations before time constraints

#### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM for small datasets (≤25K employees)
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM for standard datasets (≤100K employees)
- **High Performance**: 16GB+ RAM for large datasets (≤250K employees)
- **Storage**: 2-5GB free space per 100K employees for multi-year simulations

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

#### For Different Use Cases

**Development and Testing (≤25K employees)**
```yaml
optimization_level: low
max_years: 3-5
expected_time: 15-30 minutes
memory_requirement: 2-3GB
```

**Standard Analysis (25-100K employees)**
```yaml
optimization_level: medium
max_years: 5-7
expected_time: 30-90 minutes
memory_requirement: 3-5GB
```

**Enterprise Analysis (100-250K employees)**
```yaml
optimization_level: high
max_years: 3-5

**Scaling Beyond Limits**
For datasets >250K employees or >10 year simulations:
- Consider breaking into multiple smaller simulations
- Use higher-spec hardware with more memory
- Implement custom batch processing approaches
- Consider approximate methods for very large scale analysis
