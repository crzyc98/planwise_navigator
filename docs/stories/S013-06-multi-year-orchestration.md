# Story S013-06: Multi-Year Orchestration Transformation

**Epic**: E013 - Dagster Simulation Pipeline Modularization
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 4 story points
**Status**: Not Started

## User Story

**As a** PlanWise Navigator developer
**I want** the run_multi_year_simulation operation transformed into a pure orchestrator
**So that** it focuses solely on coordination while leveraging refactored single-year simulation logic

## Background

The current `run_multi_year_simulation` operation is 325+ lines that duplicates significant logic from `run_year_simulation`. After the modular components are implemented, this operation should be transformed into a lean orchestrator (~50 lines) that:

- Calls `clean_duckdb_data` once at the start
- Manages the year-by-year loop
- Calls the refactored `run_year_simulation` for each year
- Handles baseline snapshots and year dependencies
- Aggregates results and provides summary logging

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Pure Orchestration Focus**
   - [ ] Remove all embedded simulation logic (lines 932-1026 duplicated from single-year)
   - [ ] Remove all repetitive dbt command execution blocks
   - [ ] Focus solely on year loop management and coordination
   - [ ] Maintain identical simulation results and behavior

2. **Modular Component Integration**
   - [ ] Use `clean_duckdb_data` operation for initial data cleaning
   - [ ] Call refactored `run_year_simulation` for each simulation year
   - [ ] Use `run_dbt_snapshot_for_year` for baseline snapshots
   - [ ] Leverage all new utility functions and operations

3. **Coordination Responsibilities**
   - [ ] Manage configuration for each year
   - [ ] Handle baseline snapshot creation for start_year - 1
   - [ ] Execute year-by-year validation and dependency checks
   - [ ] Aggregate YearResult objects and provide summary logging
   - [ ] Maintain error handling that allows continuation after year failures

### Technical Requirements
1. **Operation Signature** (unchanged)
```python
@op(
    required_resource_keys={"dbt"},
    config_schema={
        "start_year": int,
        "end_year": int,
        "target_growth_rate": float,
        "total_termination_rate": float,
        "new_hire_termination_rate": float,
        "random_seed": int,
        "full_refresh": bool,
    },
)
def run_multi_year_simulation(
    context: OpExecutionContext, baseline_valid: bool
) -> List[YearResult]:
```

2. **Streamlined Implementation** (~50 lines)
   - [ ] Configuration setup and validation (5-10 lines)
   - [ ] Data cleaning call (1 line)
   - [ ] Baseline snapshot setup (3-5 lines)
   - [ ] Year loop with single-year simulation calls (20-25 lines)
   - [ ] Result aggregation and summary logging (10-15 lines)

3. **Preserved Functionality**
   - [ ] Identical error handling behavior (continue on year failure)
   - [ ] Same summary logging format and content
   - [ ] Maintained baseline snapshot creation logic
   - [ ] Preserved year dependency validation

## Implementation Details

def run_year_simulation_with_config(

    """
    Wrapper to execute run_year_simulation with specific year configuration.

    # Create a temporary context that includes the year-specific config
    # Implementation will depend on Dagster patterns for dynamic op execution

    # For now, directly call the simulation logic with the config
    # (This may need adjustment based on Dagster's execution model)
    return run_year_simulation_core_logic(context, year_config)
```

### Alternative Implementation (Direct Logic Call)
If dynamic op execution proves complex, we can extract the core logic:

```python
# Step 3: Execute simulation for each year (alternative approach)
for year in range(start_year, end_year + 1):
    context.log.info(f"=== Starting simulation for year {year} ===")

    # Validate previous year completion
    if year > start_year:
        try:
            assert_year_complete(context, year - 1)
        except Exception as e:
            # ... error handling ...
            continue

    # Execute single year simulation by calling core logic directly
    try:
        year_result = _execute_single_year_simulation(context, year, config)
        results.append(year_result)
        context.log.info(f"=== Year {year} simulation completed successfully ===")
    except Exception as e:
        # ... error handling ...
        continue

def _execute_single_year_simulation(
    context: OpExecutionContext,
    year: int,
    config: Dict[str, Any]
) -> YearResult:
    """Execute the core single-year simulation logic."""
    # This would call the refactored run_year_simulation logic
    # but with direct parameter passing rather than op config
    year_config = config.copy()
    year_config["start_year"] = year

    # Call the core simulation logic that run_year_simulation uses
    return run_year_simulation_core(context, year_config)
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complex Integration**:
   - Implement incrementally with rollback capability
   - Test each modular component integration separately
   - Maintain extensive before/after validation

2. **Op Execution Patterns**:
   - Research Dagster best practices for dynamic op execution
   - Consider alternative approaches if dynamic execution is complex
   - Validate with Dagster community/documentation

3. **Behavior Preservation**:
   - Comprehensive simulation result comparison
   - Character-by-character logging output validation
   - Mathematical verification of year-over-year calculations

**Implementation Notes**: This is the culmination of the modularization effort. The success of this story validates the entire refactoring approach. Focus on extensive testing and validation to ensure zero behavior changes while achieving maximum code reduction.
