# Story S036-02: Design Deferral Rate State Accumulator Model

**Epic**: E036 - Deferral Rate State Accumulator Architecture
**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: Critical
**Sprint**: Infrastructure Fix
**Owner**: Technical Architecture Team
**Status**: ðŸ”µ Ready for Implementation
**Type**: Architecture Design

## Story

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** to design the `int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator.sql` model following Epic E023 pattern
**So that** I can eliminate circular dependencies and enable proper temporal state tracking

## Business Context

Following the successful Epic E023 Enrollment Architecture Fix, this story designs the deferral rate state accumulator that will break the circular dependency between `int_employee_contributions` and `fct_yearly_events`. The accumulator will track deferral rate state across simulation years using a proven temporal pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Architecture Design
- [ ] **State accumulator model designed** following Epic E023 proven pattern
- [ ] **Temporal state tracking schema defined** with proper primary keys and grain
- [ ] **Multi-year state transition logic planned** for Year N using Year N-1 data
- [ ] **Data lineage and audit trail requirements documented** for compliance

### Circular Dependency Elimination
- [ ] **Source only from int_* models** - NEVER from `fct_yearly_events` to avoid circular dependency
- [ ] **Define upstream dependencies** clearly: enrollment events, escalation events, baseline workforce
- [ ] **Plan downstream integration** with `int_employee_contributions` model
- [ ] **Orchestration order defined** to ensure proper execution sequence

### Technical Design Specifications
- [ ] **Primary key schema** defined for composite uniqueness constraints
- [ ] **Data types and precision** specified for deferral rates and temporal fields
- [ ] **Materialization strategy** planned (incremental with DuckDB optimizations)
- [ ] **Performance requirements** defined (<5 second execution target)

#### Primary Keys & Uniqueness
```sql
-- Enforce via dbt tests, not DDL constraints
-- Primary key uniqueness test
{{ dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns(

```

### Temporal State Transition Logic

#### Year N State Calculation with Employee Lifecycle Integration
```sql
-- Year N uses Year N-1 accumulator data + Year N events + employment status changes
-- No circular dependencies - accumulator reads from int_* sources only

Year 1: baseline_workforce + employment_status + hce_determination â†’ state_accumulator
Year 2: (Year 1 accumulator + Year 2 events + lifecycle_changes + plan_transfers) â†’ Year 2 accumulator
Year 3: (Year 2 accumulator + Year 3 events + retroactive_adjustments + lifecycle_changes) â†’ Year 3 accumulator

-- Cross-year validation ensures continuity:
-- 1. Employment status changes properly update is_active flag
-- 2. Plan transfers preserve or reset deferral rates based on business rules
-- 3. HCE status changes apply rate restrictions retroactively if required
-- 4. Terminated employees can still receive retroactive adjustments
```

#### Enhanced State Precedence Rules with Lifecycle Integration
1. **Retroactive adjustments** (priority=0): Backdated changes with compliance implications
2. **Enrollment events** (priority=1): New enrollments or rate changes (HCE-restricted)
3. **Plan transfers** (priority=2): M&A scenarios with rate preservation logic
4. **Escalation events** (priority=3): Automatic deferral rate increases (employment-status aware)
5. **Baseline defaults** (priority=4): Initial rates for new hires (eligibility-filtered)
6. **Effective date**: Latest date wins within same priority
7. **Employment status filtering**: Events only apply if employee is eligible/active on effective date
8. **HCE rate restrictions**: Applied automatically to all rate changes for HCE employees
9. **Tie-breaking**: For same effective_date and priority, order by `source_event_id NULLS LAST`
10. **Cross-year validation**: State changes must be consistent with employment lifecycle

## Cost Attribution Architecture & Framework

### Comprehensive Cost Attribution Design Principles

The deferral rate state accumulator incorporates a comprehensive cost attribution framework that enables precise tracking, allocation, and reporting of workforce simulation costs across multiple organizational dimensions. This framework supports enterprise-grade cost modeling with full audit trails and regulatory compliance.

#### Core Cost Attribution Principles

1. **UUID-Based Precision Tracking**: Every cost event, allocation, and driver is tracked with unique identifiers for complete audit trails
2. **Multi-Dimensional Attribution**: Support for organizational hierarchy, geographic, project-based, team-based, and functional cost allocation
3. **Temporal Cost Precision**: Microsecond-level timestamp tracking for accurate cost period attribution
4. **Financial System Integration**: GL account mapping, budget period alignment, and cost center integration
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Enhanced audit trails with financial hash validation and compliance flagging
6. **Performance Attribution**: Cost variance analysis and attribution accuracy metrics for continuous improvement

### Organizational Hierarchy Integration Architecture

#### Primary Organizational Dimensions

The cost attribution framework integrates seamlessly with organizational hierarchies to provide comprehensive cost visibility:

```sql

## Employee Lifecycle Integration Business Logic

### Employment Status Integration with int_workforce_active_for_events

#### Termination/Rehire Scenarios
```sql
-- Business rules for employment status changes affecting deferral rates
CASE
  -- Active employees: all rate changes apply normally
  WHEN emp.employment_status = 'active' THEN
    'apply_rate_change'

  -- Terminated employees: only retroactive adjustments allowed
  WHEN emp.employment_status = 'terminated' AND source_type = 'retroactive_adjustment' THEN
    'apply_retroactive_only'

  -- Terminated employees: block new enrollments/escalations after termination
  WHEN emp.employment_status = 'terminated' AND effective_date > emp.termination_date THEN
    'block_future_changes'

  -- Rehired employees: reset to baseline rates unless rate preservation flag is set
  WHEN emp.rehire_date IS NOT NULL AND effective_date >= emp.rehire_date THEN
    CASE
      WHEN rate_preservation_flag = TRUE THEN 'preserve_previous_rate'
      ELSE 'reset_to_baseline'
    END

  ELSE 'default_processing'
END
```

#### Eligibility Window Logic
```sql
-- Enrollment events must occur within eligibility window
WHERE e.effective_date >= emp.eligibility_start_date
  AND (emp.termination_date IS NULL OR e.effective_date <= emp.termination_date)
```

### Plan Transfer Logic for M&A Scenarios

#### Rate Preservation Decision Matrix
```sql
-- Plan transfer deferral rate logic based on business rules
CASE
  -- Preserve rate: M&A with explicit rate preservation
  WHEN pt.rate_preservation_flag = TRUE
    AND pt.transfer_reason IN ('merger', 'acquisition', 'spinoff')
  THEN pys.current_deferral_rate

  -- Reset to new plan default: restructuring scenarios
  WHEN pt.rate_preservation_flag = FALSE
    OR pt.transfer_reason IN ('restructure', 'plan_termination')
  THEN npd.default_deferral_rate

  -- Apply HCE restrictions to transferred rates
  WHEN hce.hce_status = TRUE
    AND pys.current_deferral_rate > npd.hce_max_deferral_rate
  THEN npd.hce_max_deferral_rate

  -- Default to preserved rate with validation
  ELSE COALESCE(pys.current_deferral_rate, npd.default_deferral_rate)
END
```

#### Plan Design Compatibility Validation
```sql
-- Ensure transferred rates comply with new plan limits

```

### Retroactive Adjustment Support for Backdated Changes

#### Compliance-Driven Adjustment Logic
```sql

    CASE
      WHEN ABS(ra.adjusted_deferral_rate - ra.original_deferral_rate) > 0.02 -- 2% threshold
      THEN TRUE
      ELSE FALSE
    END as material_change_flag

  FROM current_year_retroactive_adjustments ra
)
```

#### Temporal Consistency Validation
```sql
-- Ensure retroactive adjustments don't violate temporal consistency
SELECT
  ra.employee_id,
  ra.adjustment_effective_date,
  ra.adjustment_reason
FROM current_year_retroactive_adjustments ra
LEFT JOIN previous_year_state pys

WHERE pys.employee_id IS NULL
  AND ra.adjustment_effective_date < DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)
-- Flag adjustments for periods without prior state records
```

### HCE Status Integration with Rate Restrictions

#### Automatic HCE Rate Limitation
```sql

#### HCE Status Change Impact Analysis
```sql
-- Track impact of HCE status changes on existing deferral rates
WITH hce_status_impact AS (

### Cross-Year State Continuity Validation

This comprehensive validation framework ensures perfect state integrity across multi-year simulations by implementing automated monitoring, anomaly detection, and complete audit trail verification.

#### State Consistency Validation Framework

**Core Validation Principles:**
1. **State Immutability**: No state records can be orphaned or lost across years
2. **Employment Lifecycle Integrity**: All employment transitions must have proper audit trails
3. **Rate Change Lineage**: Every deferral rate change must have traceable source attribution
4. **Temporal Consistency**: All dates and effective periods must maintain logical progression
5. **Multi-Year Coherence**: State accumulation must be mathematically consistent across simulation years

This comprehensive cross-year state continuity validation framework provides:

1. **Complete State Consistency Validation** - Detects orphaned states and missing transitions
2. **Employment Transition Validation** - Ensures all lifecycle changes follow business rules
3. **Rate Change Validation** - Validates source lineage and change reasonableness
4. **Data Lineage Validation** - Verifies complete audit trail continuity
5. **Automated Monitoring** - Proactive anomaly detection with alert thresholds
6. **dbt Test Integration** - Comprehensive data quality tests for CI/CD
7. **Performance-Optimized Monitoring** - Real-time health checks and anomaly detection

The validation system maintains the highest data quality standards while providing clear visibility into any state continuity issues across multi-year simulations.

## Design Specifications

### DuckDB Performance Requirements & Optimization Targets

#### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] **Execution time**: <2 seconds per simulation year (50% improvement from 5s target)
- [ ] **Memory usage**: <500MB peak memory for 100K employee dataset
- [ ] **Throughput**: Process 50K employees/second during state accumulation
- [ ] **Join performance**: <200ms for largest employment status join operations
- [ ] **Aggregation speed**: <100ms for year-over-year rate change calculations

#### DuckDB-Specific Optimizations
- [ ] **Columnar processing**: Leverage vectorized operations for deferral rate calculations
- [ ] **Memory management**: Use DuckDB's automatic memory management with 80% available RAM
- [ ] **Parallel execution**: Enable multi-threading with `SET threads=4` for 100K+ employee datasets
- [ ] **Query pushdown**: Optimize filter pushdown for `simulation_year` partitions
- [ ] **Join optimization**: Use DuckDB's hash join optimization for employee lifecycle joins

#### Memory-Efficient Data Types Impact
```sql
-- Memory savings from optimized types (per 1M rows):
-- HUGEINT vs UUID string: 50MB savings (16 bytes vs 36+ bytes)
-- TINYINT vs VARCHAR enums: 300MB savings (1 byte vs 10+ bytes avg)
-- FLOAT vs DECIMAL(5,4): 200MB savings (4 bytes vs 8 bytes)
-- INTEGER date vs TIMESTAMP: 400MB savings (4 bytes vs 8 bytes)
-- Total estimated memory reduction: ~950MB per 1M rows (60% improvement)
```

#### DuckDB Configuration for Optimal Performance
```sql
-- Memory and threading configuration
SET memory_limit = '80%';  -- Use 80% of available system memory
SET threads = 4;           -- Optimize for 4-core systems (adjust as needed)
SET enable_optimizer = true;
SET enable_http_metadata_cache = true;

-- Query optimization settings
SET force_parallelism = true;      -- Enable parallel query execution
SET preserve_insertion_order = false;  -- Allow query reordering for performance
SET enable_object_cache = true;    -- Cache objects for better performance

-- Storage optimization
SET checkpoint_threshold = '1GB';  -- Optimize for large datasets
```

#### Business Logic Edge Cases with Lifecycle Integration
- [ ] **Explicit 0% vs NULL**: Distinguish intentional opt-outs (0%) from missing data
- [ ] **New hires without explicit rate**: Use plan defaults from baseline with eligibility window validation
- [ ] **Enhanced timestamp tie-breaking**: retroactive > enrollment > plan_transfer > escalation > baseline, then by source_event_id
- [ ] **Plan min/max bounds**: Apply plan-level rate bounds validation with HCE restrictions
- [ ] **Employee lifecycle integration**: Comprehensive employment status validation through `int_workforce_active_for_events`
- [ ] **Termination scenarios**: Allow retroactive adjustments for terminated employees, block future enrollments
- [ ] **Rehire scenarios**: Reset to baseline or preserve rates based on business rules and rate_preservation_flag
- [ ] **Plan transfer scenarios**: Handle M&A rate preservation with plan design compatibility validation
- [ ] **HCE status changes**: Automatic rate restriction application when employees become HCEs
- [ ] **Cross-year continuity**: Validate employment transitions and state consistency across simulation years
- [ ] **Retroactive adjustment scope**: Handle backdated changes with proper compliance flagging
- [ ] **Eligibility window enforcement**: Ensure all rate changes occur within valid employment/participation periods

### Enhanced Integration Points with Employment Lifecycle

#### Upstream Dependencies (Sources)
1. `int_enrollment_events` - enrollment deferral rates (filtered by employment status)
2. `int_deferral_rate_escalation_events` - automatic rate increases (employment-status aware)
3. `int_baseline_workforce` - default rates for new hires (eligibility-filtered)
4. `int_workforce_active_for_events` - employment status, termination/rehire tracking
5. `int_hce_determination` - HCE status for rate restrictions
6. `int_plan_transfer_events` - M&A scenarios with rate preservation logic
7. `int_retroactive_deferral_adjustments` - backdated changes with compliance tracking
8. Previous year's `int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator` - temporal state with lifecycle continuity

#### Downstream Integration (Consumers)
1. `int_employee_contributions` - contribution calculations with lifecycle-aware active status
2. `validate_deferral_rate_continuity` - cross-year state consistency validation
3. `fct_workforce_snapshot` - final workforce state with comprehensive employment tracking
4. Compliance/reporting models - regulatory flagging and audit trail
5. Analytics dashboards - employment lifecycle impact analysis
6. Cost attribution models - lifecycle-aware cost allocation

### Materialization Strategy

#### DuckDB-Optimized Incremental Configuration
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key=['scenario_id', 'plan_design_id', 'employee_id', 'simulation_year'],
    incremental_strategy='merge',
    -- DuckDB-specific optimizations
    pre_hook=[
      "SET memory_limit = '80%'",
      "SET threads = 4",
      "SET force_parallelism = true",
      "SET enable_optimizer = true"
    ],
    post_hook=[
      "ANALYZE {{ this }}",  -- Update statistics for query optimizer
      "CHECKPOINT"           -- Force checkpoint for optimal storage
    ]
) }}

-- DuckDB Query Hints for Optimal Execution
/*+ USE_HASH_JOIN(current_year_employment_status) */
/*+ PARALLEL_HASH_JOIN */
```

#### DuckDB Performance Optimizations
- **Vectorized processing**: DuckDB automatically vectorizes arithmetic operations on deferral rates
- **Columnar compression**: Pre-computed derived columns reduce repeated calculations
- **Hash join optimization**: Use employee_id_hash for faster join performance
- **Memory-aware processing**: Automatic spill-to-disk for datasets exceeding memory
- **Parallel execution**: Multi-threaded processing for employee lifecycle joins
- **Early materialization**: Compute enum conversions once for reuse across CTEs

#### Advanced DuckDB Features
```sql
-- Use DuckDB's advanced analytical functions for state transitions
WITH optimized_state_changes AS (
  SELECT *,
    -- Window functions optimized for columnar storage
    LAG(current_deferral_rate) OVER (
      PARTITION BY employee_id
      ORDER BY simulation_year, effective_date
    ) as previous_rate,

    -- Use DuckDB's fast aggregation for rate change detection
    COUNT(*) OVER (
      PARTITION BY employee_id
      ORDER BY simulation_year
      ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as change_sequence,

    -- Leverage DuckDB's efficient date arithmetic
    DATE_DIFF('month', effective_date, CURRENT_DATE) as months_elapsed

  FROM unified_state_changes
)

-- DuckDB automatic query optimization will:
-- 1. Push filters down to storage layer
-- 2. Optimize join order based on cardinality
-- 3. Use columnar vectorization for aggregations
-- 4. Parallelize window function computation
```

#### Memory Management Strategy
```sql
-- Monitor memory usage during execution
SELECT
  'Memory Usage' as metric,
  current_setting('memory_limit') as memory_limit,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('{{ this }}')) as table_size
FROM (VALUES (1)) as dummy(x);

-- DuckDB automatic memory management:
-- - Spills to disk when memory threshold exceeded
-- - Compresses columnar data automatically
-- - Uses memory mapping for large datasets
-- - Optimizes memory allocation per thread
```

## Notes

This DuckDB-optimized design provides significant performance improvements over the original specification:

### Key DuckDB Optimizations Applied
1. **Memory-Efficient Data Types**: 60% memory reduction using HUGEINT, TINYINT, and FLOAT types
2. **Vectorized Processing**: Leverages DuckDB's columnar architecture for 10x faster calculations
3. **Hash Join Optimization**: Pre-computed hash keys and composite indexes for faster joins
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded processing with automatic memory management
5. **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with regression detection

### Performance Improvement Targets
- **Execution Time**: <2 seconds per year (50% improvement from 5s baseline)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for 100K employees (60% reduction through optimized types)
- **Throughput**: 50K employees/second processing (10x improvement through vectorization)
- **Join Performance**: <200ms for largest employment joins (5x improvement through hash optimization)

This design ensures the state accumulator implementation follows proven Epic E023 patterns while maximizing DuckDB analytical performance capabilities for sub-second workforce simulation queries.

### Key Implementation Notes
- **Upstream model reference corrected**: `int_deferral_rate_escalation_events` (not `int_deferral_escalation_events`)
- **Schema normalization**: All CTEs use common schema with `scenario_id`, `plan_design_id` propagation
- **Deterministic precedence**: enrollment > escalation > baseline, then latest effective_date
- **Baseline seeding**: Anti-join approach prevents all baseline records after Year 1
- **Materialization**: `merge` strategy with proper unique_key, not `insert_overwrite`
- **Audit fields**: Deterministic timestamps, single source_event_id, JSON as TEXT for portability
