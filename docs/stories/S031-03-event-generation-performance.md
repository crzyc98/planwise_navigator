## Employee Lifecycle Modeling - Technical Specifications

### Optimized Event Generation Architecture

#### Batch Event Generation Engine
```python
class BatchEventGenerator:
    """High-performance batch event generation with lifecycle state transitions"""

    def __init__(self, duckdb_connection: DuckDBConnection, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.conn = duckdb_connection
        self.config = config
        self.batch_size = 10000  # Optimal batch size for DuckDB
        self.event_registry = {}  # Track event sequences per employee

    def generate_lifecycle_events_batch(
        self,
        simulation_year: int,
        workforce_snapshot: str,
        random_seed: int = 42
    ) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """Generate all lifecycle events in optimized batch operations"""
```

#### State Transition Management
- **Active → Terminated**: Hazard-based probability calculations with age/tenure multipliers
- **Hired → Active**: Immediate eligibility determination with waiting period logic
- **Active → Promoted**: Level-aware advancement with compensation adjustments
- **Merit Eligible → Adjusted**: Annual compensation updates with COLA integration

#### Optimized Hire Event Generation
```sql

    CROSS JOIN generate_series(1, hr.required_hires)
)
INSERT INTO fct_yearly_events SELECT * FROM generated_hires;
```

### Termination Event Optimization
```sql
