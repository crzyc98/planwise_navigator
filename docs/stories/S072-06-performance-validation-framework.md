# Story S072-06: Performance & Validation Framework

**Epic**: E021-A - DC Plan Event Schema Foundation
**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: High
**Sprint**: 3
**Owner**: Platform Team

## Story

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** a comprehensive performance and validation framework for the event schema
**So that** we meet enterprise performance targets and ensure data quality with automated testing

## Business Context

This story creates the performance and validation infrastructure that ensures the event schema can handle enterprise-scale workloads while maintaining data quality. It establishes performance benchmarks, automated validation, golden dataset testing, and the snapshot strategy needed for production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Event ingest performance**: ≥100K events/sec using DuckDB vectorized inserts (16-core M2, 32GB)
- [ ] **History reconstruction**: ≤5s for 5-year participant history (MacBook Pro M3, 16GB)
- [ ] **Schema validation**: <10ms per event validation with Pydantic v2
- [ ] **Memory efficiency**: <8GB for 100K employee simulation

### Validation Framework
- [ ] **JSON schema validation**: ≥99% success rate in CI (build fails if any events are invalid)
- [ ] **Golden dataset validation**: 100% match with benchmark calculations (zero variance)
- [ ] **Unit test coverage**: >95% for all 11 payload types with edge case coverage
- [ ] **Integration test suite**: Complete workflow testing for all event combinations

### Snapshot Strategy
- [ ] **Weekly balance snapshots** stored in `fct_participant_balance_snapshots`
- [ ] **Optimized query performance** using pre-computed snapshots
- [ ] **Event reconstruction fallback** for detailed audit trails
- [ ] **Snapshot validation** ensuring consistency with event history

### Enterprise Validation
- [ ] **CI/CD integration** with automated schema validation
- [ ] **Performance regression testing** with benchmark comparisons
- [ ] **Data quality monitoring** with automated alerts
- [ ] **Golden dataset drift detection** with variance analysis

## Dependencies

- [ ] **≤5s history reconstruction** for 5-year participant history
- [ ] **<10ms schema validation** per event
- [ ] **<8GB memory usage** for 100K employee simulation

### Quality Targets
- [ ] **≥99% CI validation success** (build fails below threshold)
- [ ] **100% golden dataset match** (zero variance tolerance)
- [ ] **>95% unit test coverage** for all payload types
- [ ] **Zero performance regression** in production deployment

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Tests
- [ ] **Bulk ingest testing** with 100K+ events
- [ ] **History reconstruction** with realistic participant data
- [ ] **Memory profiling** under high load
- [ ] **Concurrent access** testing with multiple scenarios

### Validation Tests
- [ ] **Golden dataset validation** with benchmark scenarios
- [ ] **Schema compliance** testing for all 11 event types
- [ ] **Edge case validation** with boundary conditions
- [ ] **Regression testing** against previous versions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **End-to-end workflow** testing with complete participant lifecycle
- [ ] **Snapshot consistency** validation with event reconstruction
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** testing with automated validation
- [ ] **Production deployment** validation with performance monitoring

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Performance framework implemented** with automated testing
- [ ] **All performance targets met** on specified hardware configurations
- [ ] **Golden dataset validation** achieving 100% benchmark match
- [ ] **CI/CD integration complete** with ≥99% validation success
- [ ] **Snapshot strategy implemented** with weekly balance snapshots
- [ ] **Comprehensive test coverage** >95% for all event types
- [ ] **Documentation complete** with performance benchmarks and validation procedures
- [ ] **Production monitoring** ready with automated alerting

## Notes
