# Story S072-02: Workforce Event Integration

**Epic**: E021-A - DC Plan Event Schema Foundation
**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: High
**Sprint**: 1
**Owner**: Platform Team

## Story

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** existing workforce events integrated into the unified event model
**So that** hire, promotion, termination, and merit events work seamlessly with DC plan events

## Business Context

This story ensures backward compatibility by integrating the existing workforce simulation events (hire, promotion, termination, merit) into the new unified event architecture. This maintains existing functionality while preparing for DC plan event expansion.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workforce Event Integration
- [x] **All 4 workforce events** integrated: hire, promotion, termination, merit
- [x] **Backward compatibility maintained** with existing workforce simulation
- [x] **Enhanced payloads** with optional `plan_id` field for DC plan linking
- [x] **Discriminated union integration** working with core SimulationEvent model

### Enhanced Event Coverage
- [x] **HirePayload** includes plan eligibility context
- [x] **PromotionPayload** includes compensation impact for HCE determination
- [x] **TerminationPayload** includes reason codes for distribution processing
- [x] **MeritPayload** includes percentage tracking for compliance calculations

## Technical Specifications

### Workforce Event Payloads

```python
from typing import Literal, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from datetime import date
from decimal import Decimal

class HirePayload(BaseModel):
    """Employee onboarding with plan eligibility context"""

    event_type: Literal["hire"] = "hire"
    plan_id: Optional[str] = None  # Links to DC plan when applicable
    hire_date: date
    department: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    job_level: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=10)
    annual_compensation: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, decimal_places=6)

class PromotionPayload(BaseModel):
    """Level changes affecting contribution capacity and HCE status"""

    event_type: Literal["promotion"] = "promotion"
    plan_id: Optional[str] = None
    new_job_level: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=10)
    new_annual_compensation: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, decimal_places=6)

class TerminationPayload(BaseModel):
    """Employment end triggering distribution eligibility"""

    event_type: Literal["termination"] = "termination"
    plan_id: Optional[str] = None
    termination_reason: Literal[
        "voluntary", "involuntary", "retirement", "death", "disability"
    ]

```

### Updated SimulationEvent Model

```python
# Extending the core model from S072-01
class SimulationEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... core fields from S072-01 ...

    # Updated discriminated union with workforce events
    payload: Union[
        Annotated[HirePayload, Field(discriminator='event_type')],
        Annotated[PromotionPayload, Field(discriminator='event_type')],
        Annotated[TerminationPayload, Field(discriminator='event_type')],
        Annotated[MeritPayload, Field(discriminator='event_type')],
        # Placeholder for DC plan events (S072-03, S072-04, S072-05)
    ] = Field(..., discriminator='event_type')
```

### Workforce Event Factory

```python
class WorkforceEventFactory(EventFactory):
    """Factory for creating workforce events with DC plan context"""

    @staticmethod
    def create_hire_event(
        employee_id: str,
        scenario_id: str,
        plan_design_id: str,
        hire_date: date,
        department: str,
        job_level: int,
        annual_compensation: Decimal,
        plan_id: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> SimulationEvent:
        """Create hire event with optional plan context"""

        payload = HirePayload(
            hire_date=hire_date,
            department=department,
            job_level=job_level,
            annual_compensation=annual_compensation,
            plan_id=plan_id
        )

        return SimulationEvent(
            employee_id=employee_id,
            scenario_id=scenario_id,
            plan_design_id=plan_design_id,
            effective_date=hire_date,
            source_system="workforce_simulation",
            payload=payload
        )

    @staticmethod
    def create_merit_event(
        employee_id: str,
        scenario_id: str,
        plan_design_id: str,
        effective_date: date,
        new_compensation: Decimal,
        merit_percentage: Decimal,
        plan_id: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> SimulationEvent:
        """Create merit event with HCE impact tracking"""

        payload = MeritPayload(
            new_compensation=new_compensation,
            merit_percentage=merit_percentage,
            plan_id=plan_id
        )

        return SimulationEvent(
            employee_id=employee_id,
            scenario_id=scenario_id,
            plan_design_id=plan_design_id,
            effective_date=effective_date,
            source_system="workforce_simulation",
            payload=payload
        )
```

## Migration Strategy

### Gradual Migration
1. **New events** use unified SimulationEvent model
2. **Existing events** continue working with legacy format
3. **Migration utility** converts legacy events to new format
4. **Validation period** ensures both formats work
5. **Cutover** to unified model after validation

### Data Compatibility
- **Optional plan_id** allows gradual DC plan integration
- **Same field names** maintain compatibility where possible
- **Enhanced validation** improves data quality
- **Factory methods** provide consistent event creation

## Notes

This story maintains the existing workforce simulation functionality while preparing the foundation for DC plan events. The optional `plan_id` field allows gradual integration with retirement plan features without breaking existing workforce-only simulations.
