## Implementation Details

### Documentation Updates Required

#### 1. Architecture Documentation Update
```markdown
# docs/architecture.md (Updated Section)

## Simulation Pipeline Architecture (Post-Modularization)

The workforce simulation pipeline follows a modular, single-responsibility design:

### Core Components

1. **execute_dbt_command()** - Centralized dbt command execution utility
   - Handles command construction with variables and flags
   - Standardizes error handling and logging
   - Used by all operations requiring dbt execution

2. **clean_duckdb_data()** - Data cleaning operation
   - Removes existing simulation data for specified years
   - Called once at start of multi-year simulations
   - Handles transaction safety and error recovery

3. **run_dbt_event_models_for_year()** - Event processing operation
   - Executes Epic 11.5 event model sequence
   - Includes hiring calculation debug logging
   - Handles year-specific parameter passing

4. **run_dbt_snapshot_for_year()** - Snapshot management operation
   - Creates SCD snapshots for workforce state tracking
   - Supports baseline, end-of-year, and recovery snapshots
   - Validates prerequisites before execution

5. **run_year_simulation()** - Single-year simulation orchestrator
   - Coordinates modular operations for one simulation year
   - Maintains Epic 11.5 sequence requirements
   - Handles validation and error recovery

6. **run_multi_year_simulation()** - Multi-year simulation orchestrator
   - Pure coordination layer (50 lines vs original 325)
   - Manages year-by-year execution
   - Aggregates results and handles multi-year dependencies

### Data Flow
```
Configuration → clean_duckdb_data() → [For each year] → run_year_simulation()
                                                      ├── execute_dbt_command() (multiple)
                                                      ├── run_dbt_event_models_for_year()
                                                      └── run_dbt_snapshot_for_year()
```

### Benefits Achieved
- 60% code reduction in run_multi_year_simulation
- Eliminated 100% of code duplication between single/multi-year operations
- Centralized dbt command patterns (15+ repetitive blocks → 1 utility)
- Single-responsibility operations for improved testability
```

#### 2. Developer Guide Creation
```markdown
# docs/developer-guide-modular-pipeline.md

## Working with the Modular Simulation Pipeline

### Quick Start
The simulation pipeline is now built from modular, single-responsibility operations.
Each operation can be tested and modified independently.

### Adding New dbt Commands
Use the centralized utility instead of direct dbt.cli() calls:

```python
# Old pattern (avoid)
invocation = dbt.cli(["run", "--select", "my_model", "--vars", f"{{year: {year}}}"], context=context).wait()
if invocation.process is None or invocation.process.returncode != 0:
    # error handling...

# New pattern (preferred)
execute_dbt_command(
    context,
    ["run", "--select", "my_model"],
    {"year": year},
    full_refresh=False,
    description="my model execution"
)
```

### Modifying Event Processing
Event model logic is centralized in run_dbt_event_models_for_year().
To add new event models:

1. Add model name to event_models list
2. Ensure model accepts standard simulation variables
3. Add any special debugging logic if needed
4. Update tests to include new model

### Debugging Simulations
Each modular operation logs its execution:
- execute_dbt_command logs all dbt commands and their variables
- Event processing includes detailed hiring calculation debug output
- Snapshot operations log record counts and validation results

Use operation-specific logging to isolate issues:
```bash
# Filter logs by operation
dagster logs | grep "run_dbt_event_models_for_year"
```

### Testing New Components
Each modular operation has dedicated unit tests:
- tests/unit/test_execute_dbt_command.py
- tests/unit/test_event_models_operation.py
- tests/unit/test_clean_duckdb_data.py

Integration tests validate end-to-end behavior:
- tests/integration/test_simulation_behavior_comparison.py
```

#### 3. Migration Guide Creation
```markdown
# docs/migration-guide-pipeline-refactoring.md

## Migration Guide: Pipeline Refactoring Changes

### For Developers Familiar with Pre-Refactoring Code

#### Key Changes Summary
1. **run_multi_year_simulation** reduced from 325 lines to ~50 lines
2. **Repetitive dbt commands** replaced with execute_dbt_command() utility
3. **Event processing** extracted into dedicated operation
4. **Data cleaning** moved to separate operation
5. **Snapshot management** centralized in dedicated operation

#### Code Location Changes

| Old Location | New Location | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Embedded dbt commands | execute_dbt_command() | Centralized utility |
| Lines 932-1026 (multi-year events) | run_dbt_event_models_for_year() | Eliminated duplication |
| Lines 834-848 (data cleaning) | clean_duckdb_data() | Separate operation |
| Snapshot logic | run_dbt_snapshot_for_year() | Centralized management |

#### Debugging Changes
- **Hiring calculation debug logs**: Now in run_dbt_event_models_for_year()
- **dbt command errors**: Standardized format from execute_dbt_command()
- **Operation-specific logs**: Each modular operation has distinct log patterns

#### Testing Changes
- **Unit tests**: New tests for each modular operation
- **Integration tests**: Comprehensive before/after validation
- **Performance tests**: Benchmarking framework added

#### What Stayed the Same
- **Simulation results**: Mathematically identical output
- **Configuration**: Same parameter structure and values
- **Epic 11.5 sequence**: Exact same event processing order
- **Error handling**: Same error scenarios and recovery behavior
- **Validation logic**: Unchanged validation functions and criteria
```

#### 4. Function Documentation Examples
```python
def execute_dbt_command(
    context: OpExecutionContext,
    command: List[str],
    vars_dict: Dict[str, Any],
    full_refresh: bool = False,
    description: str = ""
) -> None:
    """
    Execute a dbt command with standardized error handling and logging.

    This utility centralizes dbt command execution patterns used throughout
    the simulation pipeline. It handles variable string construction,
    full_refresh flag addition, and provides consistent error reporting.

    Args:
        context: Dagster operation execution context
        command: Base dbt command as list (e.g., ["run", "--select", "model_name"])
        vars_dict: Variables to pass to dbt as --vars (e.g., {"simulation_year": 2025})
        full_refresh: Whether to add --full-refresh flag to command
        description: Human-readable description for logging and error messages

    Raises:
        Exception: When dbt command fails with details from stdout/stderr

    Examples:
        Basic model run:
        >>> execute_dbt_command(context, ["run", "--select", "my_model"], {}, False, "my model")

        With variables and full refresh:
        >>> execute_dbt_command(
        ...     context,
        ...     ["run", "--select", "int_hiring_events"],
        ...     {"simulation_year": 2025, "random_seed": 42},
        ...     True,
        ...     "hiring events for 2025"
        ... )

        Snapshot execution:
        >>> execute_dbt_command(
        ...     context,
        ...     ["snapshot", "--select", "scd_workforce_state"],
        ...     {"simulation_year": 2025},
        ...     False,
        ...     "workforce state snapshot"
        ... )
    """
```
