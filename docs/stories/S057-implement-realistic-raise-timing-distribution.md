# Story S057: Implement Realistic Raise Timing Distribution

**Story ID**: S057
**Story Name**: Implement Realistic Raise Timing Distribution
**Epic**: E012 - Compensation System Integrity Fix (Phase 3)
**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: Must Have
**Sprint**: 8 (June 27, 2025)
**Status**: Complete
**Assigned To**: Engineering Team
**Business Owner**: Analytics Team

## Problem Statement

Based on S055 audit findings and S056 design specifications, implement the realistic raise timing distribution system to replace the current 50/50 Jan/July split with industry-aligned monthly patterns. Additionally, fix the S041 multi-year simulation debug inconsistency discovered during implementation.

### Implementation Scope

**Primary Deliverable**: Realistic raise timing distribution
- Replace hard-coded 50/50 timing with configurable monthly distribution
- Implement hash-based algorithm for realistic patterns (28% Jan, 18% Apr, 23% Jul)
- Maintain full backward compatibility with legacy mode

**Secondary Deliverable**: S041 debug consistency fix
- Resolve workforce count discrepancy in debug logs (5747 vs 4506)
- Align debug function data source logic with validation functions

## User Story

**As a** workforce analytics team member
**I want** realistic raise timing distribution throughout the year and consistent debug output
**So that** simulation results credibly reflect actual business practices and provide trustworthy validation metrics

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Realistic Timing System Architecture

**Dual-Mode Design**:
- **Legacy Mode**: Maintains current 50/50 Jan/July split for backward compatibility
- **Realistic Mode**: Implements industry-aligned monthly distribution

**Configuration Framework**:
```yaml
raise_timing:
  methodology: "realistic"  # Options: "legacy", "realistic"
  distribution_profile: "general_corporate"
  validation_tolerance: 0.02  # ±2% monthly variance tolerance
```

**Hash-Based Distribution Algorithm**:
- Two-stage hashing for month selection and day allocation
- Deterministic behavior with same random seed
- Configurable monthly percentages via seed data

### 2. Files Implemented/Modified

**New dbt Macros**:
- `dbt/macros/get_realistic_raise_date.sql` - Router macro for timing methodology
- `dbt/macros/realistic_timing_calculation.sql` - Hash-based distribution algorithm
- `dbt/macros/legacy_timing_calculation.sql` - Backward compatibility mode

**Configuration Files**:
- `dbt/seeds/config_raise_timing_distribution.csv` - Monthly distribution percentages
- `dbt/seeds/config_timing_validation_rules.csv` - Validation criteria
- `config/simulation_config.yaml` - User-facing configuration
- `dbt/dbt_project.yml` - Default variable values

**Core Logic Updates**:
- `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_merit_events.sql` - Uses new macro system
- `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py` - Variable passing and debug fix
- `dbt/models/marts/schema.yml` - Event type validation update

**Testing Framework**:
- `tests/test_monthly_distribution_accuracy.sql` - Distribution validation
- `tests/test_backward_compatibility_legacy_mode.sql` - Regression testing
- `tests/test_configuration_validation.sql` - Config parameter validation
- `tests/test_deterministic_behavior.sql` - Reproducibility testing

### 3. S041 Debug Consistency Fix

**Problem**: Debug function used different data source than validation function
- **Debug**: Always queried `int_workforce_previous_year` (stale data)
- **Validation**: Used year-conditional logic (baseline for 2025, snapshots for 2026+)

**Solution**: Aligned debug function with validation logic
- Year 2025: Query `int_baseline_workforce` (4378 employees)
- Year 2026+: Query `fct_workforce_snapshot` from previous year (4506 for 2026)

| November | 2% | Minor adjustments |
| December | 2% | Year-end adjustments |

### S041 Debug Fix Results
- **Consistent Logging**: Debug and validation functions now report same workforce counts
