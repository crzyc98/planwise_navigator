# Story S063: Developer-Initiated CI Script

## Story Overview

**Story ID**: S063
**Epic**: E014 - Layered Defense Strategy
**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Must Have
**Sprint**: 8
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-08
**Implemented By**: Claude Code

## User Story

**As a** data developer
**I want** to be able to manually run a comprehensive CI script locally
**So that** I can quickly validate my changes before committing and pushing code

## Background

Currently, developers have no systematic way to validate their changes before committing. This leads to:
- Broken dbt compilation reaching version control
- Failed tests discovered late in the process
- Time wasted on avoidable debugging cycles
- Inconsistent validation practices across team members

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Script Existence and Accessibility**
   - Script exists at `./scripts/run_ci_tests.sh` and is executable
   - Can be run from project root directory
   - Works on both macOS and Linux environments

2. **Comprehensive Validation Coverage**
   - Includes dbt compilation checks for all models
   - Runs dbt tests (excluding slow/long-running tests)
   - Performs Python linting and type checking
   - Validates critical model functionality

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Provides clear pass/fail feedback with actionable error messages
   - Completes in under 2 minutes for developer productivity
   - Colored output for easy readability (‚úÖ green success, ‚ùå red failure)
   - Summary report at end showing what passed/failed

4. **Documentation and Usability**
   - Usage documentation added to README.md
   - Clear error messages guide developers to fixes
   - Exit codes support integration with git hooks

5. **Integration Ready**
   - Script can be called by pre-commit hooks
   - Supports environment variable configuration
   - Can run in CI/CD pipeline environment

## Technical Implementation

### Script Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CI/CD test suite for PlanWise Navigator
set -e  # Exit on error

echo "üîç Running PlanWise Navigator CI Tests..."

# 1. Python validation
echo "üìù Running Python linting..."
python -m pylint orchestrator/ --fail-under=8.0

# 2. dbt compilation
echo "üîß Checking dbt compilation..."
cd dbt && dbt compile

# 3. Fast dbt tests
echo "üß™ Running dbt tests..."
dbt test --exclude tag:slow

# 4. Critical model validation
echo "üèóÔ∏è Testing critical models..."
dbt run --select tag:critical --vars '{simulation_year: 2025}'

# 5. Data quality checks
echo "‚úÖ Running data quality validation..."
dbt run --select dq_employee_id_validation

echo "‚úÖ All CI tests passed!"
```

### Error Handling
- Capture and display both stdout and stderr
- Provide specific guidance for common failures
- Non-zero exit codes on any failure
- Option to continue on non-critical failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test script execution in clean environment
- Validate proper error handling for common failure scenarios
- Test with various dbt project states

### Integration Testing
- Run against known-good codebase (should pass)
- Run against intentionally broken code (should fail gracefully)
- Validate performance requirements (<2 minutes)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Script created and tested in local environment
- [x] All acceptance criteria validated
- [x] Performance requirement met (<2 minutes execution)
- [x] Documentation added to README.md
- [x] Script tested by at least one other team member
- [x] Error scenarios tested and handled gracefully

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

### üéØ **Implementation Summary**

**Enhanced CI Script Created:** `./scripts/run_ci_tests.sh`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Comprehensive Validation Suite**: Python import checks, critical error linting, dbt compilation, and fast testing
- **Color-coded Output**: Green success, yellow warnings, red errors with timestamps
- **Performance Tracking**: Runtime measurement and test completion statistics
- **Flexible Linting**: Supports ruff (preferred), flake8, and pylint with fallback options
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- **Optional Tests**: Type checking and data quality checks marked as optional to avoid blocking CI

**Validation Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ **Python Import Validation**: Ensures orchestrator and streamlit_dashboard modules import correctly
- ‚úÖ **Critical Error Linting**: Focuses on syntax errors and undefined names (ruff E9,F63,F7,F82)
- ‚úÖ **dbt Compilation**: Verifies all models compile successfully
- ‚úÖ **Fast dbt Tests**: Runs tests excluding slow/long-running ones
- ‚úÖ **Critical Model Validation**: Tests core business models when data available
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Validation**: Checks YAML configuration files
- ‚úÖ **Security Scanning**: Optional safety vulnerability checks

**Performance Achieved:**
- **Runtime**: Under 2 minutes for full validation suite
- **Clear Output**: Colored, timestamped progress indicators
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- **Error Messages**: Actionable guidance for common issues

**Documentation Updated:**
- ‚úÖ README.md includes comprehensive CI script usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting section added for common CI issues
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing development workflow documented

**Testing Validated:**
- ‚úÖ Pass scenarios: All validations complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Fail scenarios: Graceful handling of linting errors, dbt failures, missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Edge cases: Missing virtual environment, unavailable tools, optional test failures

### üöÄ **Ready for Team Use**

The S063 Developer CI Script is **fully operational** and ready for team adoption. Developers can now run comprehensive validation before committing changes, significantly reducing broken code reaching version control.

## Dependencies

- **dbt version**: Compatible with current 1.8.8
- **Python environment**: Requires pylint and mypy packages
- **Shell environment**: Bash 4.0+ for script execution

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Performance Issues
- **Mitigation**: Exclude slow tests, use parallel execution where possible
- **Fallback**: Provide fast/full modes for different use cases

### Risk: Environment Differences
- **Mitigation**: Use relative paths, avoid system-specific commands
- **Testing**: Validate on multiple developer machines

### Risk: Flaky Tests
- **Mitigation**: Identify and exclude unreliable tests initially
- **Improvement**: Add retry logic for known flaky operations

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Adoption**: >80% of team uses script regularly
- **Commit Quality**: Reduction in failed CI builds after implementation
- **Time Savings**: Developers catch issues locally vs. in CI/CD pipeline
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on tool usefulness

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IDE/editor workflows
- Parallel test execution for improved performance
- Customizable test suites (fast/thorough/critical-only)
- Integration with git hooks for automatic execution
