# Story S036-03: Implement Temporal State Tracking

**Epic**: E036 - Deferral Rate State Accumulator Architecture
**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Critical
**Sprint**: Infrastructure Fix
**Owner**: Technical Architecture Team
**Status**: ðŸ”µ Ready for Implementation
**Type**: Implementation

## Story

**As a** platform engineer
**I want** to implement the `int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator.sql` model with temporal state tracking
**So that** deferral rate state is properly maintained across simulation years without circular dependencies

## Business Context

This is the core implementation story that creates the `int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator.sql` model. Following the design from S036-02, this model will track deferral rate state across simulation years using the proven Epic E023 temporal accumulator pattern, eliminating the circular dependency that currently prevents multi-year simulation execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Model Implementation
- [ ] **Create `int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator.sql`** with incremental materialization
- [ ] **Implement monthly temporal grain** with 12 rows per employee per year using forward-fill logic
- [ ] **Define composite primary keys** preventing duplicate states: `(scenario_id, plan_design_id, employee_id, simulation_year, as_of_month)`
- [ ] **Handle all edge cases** including explicit 0% vs NULL, opt-out escalation suppression, plan min/max bounds

### Year 0 Seeding & Multi-Year Logic
- [ ] **Year 0 seeding logic** with explicit behavior when prior state is absent (seed from `int_baseline_workforce`)
- [ ] **Multi-year state transition** where Year N uses Year N-1 accumulator data + Year N events
- [ ] **Precedence rules implemented** with `event_priority` (enrollment=1, escalation=2, baseline=3) + `effective_date`
- [ ] **Employee lifecycle handling** including termination (`is_active=false`) and rehire scenarios

## Edge Case Handling Implementation

### Explicit 0% vs NULL/Missing
```sql
-- Distinguish intentional opt-outs (0%) from missing data
CASE
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate = 0.0000 THEN 0.0000  -- Explicit 0% opt-out
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate IS NULL AND source_type = 'enrollment' THEN 0.0000  -- NULL enrollment = opt-out
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate IS NULL AND source_type = 'baseline' THEN 0.0300  -- 3% default for new hires
  ELSE employee_deferral_rate
END as processed_deferral_rate
```

### Multiple Changes Per Year
```sql
-- Deterministic precedence handling: latest effective_date primary, priority secondary
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY scenario_id, plan_design_id, employee_id
  ORDER BY
    effective_date DESC,        -- Latest date wins (primary)
    event_priority ASC,         -- enrollment=1 > escalation=2 > baseline=3 (tie-breaker)
    event_id ASC                -- Final tie-breaker for same-timestamp events
) as rn
```

### Employee Lifecycle Transitions
```sql
-- Termination handling with monthly precision
CASE
  WHEN es.employment_status = 'terminated' THEN FALSE
  WHEN es.termination_date IS NOT NULL AND es.termination_date <= ms.as_of_month THEN FALSE
  ELSE TRUE
END as is_active,

-- Rehire logic: if employee was terminated and returns, seed from baseline or restore prior rate
rehire_state AS (
  SELECT
    scenario_id, plan_design_id, employee_id,
    -- Check if employee exists in baseline but was terminated in prior year
    CASE
      WHEN bd.employee_id IS NOT NULL AND pys.employment_status = 'terminated'
      THEN 'rehire'
      ELSE 'new_hire'
    END as hire_type,
    -- For rehires, use plan default; could be enhanced to restore prior rate if available
    COALESCE(bd.baseline_deferral_rate, 0.0300) as deferral_rate
  FROM {{ ref('int_baseline_workforce') }} bd
  LEFT JOIN previous_year_state pys USING (scenario_id, plan_design_id, employee_id)
  WHERE bd.simulation_year = {{ var('simulation_year') }}
)
```

### Plan Min/Max Bounds Validation
```sql
-- Apply plan-level bounds with violation flagging
bounded_deferral_rate,
CASE
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate < 0.0000 THEN 'below_minimum'  -- Cannot be negative
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate > 0.5000 THEN 'above_maximum'  -- Example 50% max
  ELSE 'within_bounds'
END as bounds_validation_status,

-- Bounds applied in bounded_state_changes CTE
CASE
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate < 0.0000 THEN 0.0000
  WHEN employee_deferral_rate > 0.5000 THEN 0.5000
  ELSE ROUND(employee_deferral_rate, 4)
END as bounded_deferral_rate
```

## Performance Optimization

### Data Types & Precision
```sql
-- Use DECIMAL(5,4) for deferral rates to avoid float drift
current_deferral_rate DECIMAL(5,4)     -- 0.0000 to 1.0000 (0% to 100%)

-- Round consistently to prevent precision drift
ROUND(employee_deferral_rate, 4) as bounded_deferral_rate
```

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Filter by simulation_year to avoid full scans
WHERE simulation_year = {{ var('simulation_year') }}

-- Use targeted EXISTS checks instead of large JOINs
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM current_year_enrollment_changes cyec
  WHERE cyec.employee_id = pys.employee_id
)
```

### Materialization Strategy
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key=['scenario_id', 'plan_design_id', 'employee_id', 'simulation_year', 'as_of_month'],
    incremental_strategy='delete+insert',    -- DuckDB compatible
    on_schema_change='sync_all_columns'      -- Handle schema evolution
) }}
```

## Implementation Notes & Design Decisions

### Monthly vs. Payroll-Period Grain
This implementation uses **monthly grain** for simplicity and broad applicability. Each employee gets 12 rows per simulation year with forward-fill logic to maintain state consistency. If payroll-period awareness is needed later, the months CTE can be replaced with a payroll calendar dimension.

### Escalation Suppression Strategy
Escalation events are suppressed for employees who:
- Have `employee_deferral_rate = 0.0000` in enrollment events (explicit opt-out)
- Have `escalation_opt_out = TRUE` flag in enrollment events
- This prevents unwanted automatic increases for employees who explicitly opted out

### Precedence Rules Clarification
- **Primary**: Latest `effective_date` wins (most recent decision)
- **Secondary**: `event_priority` breaks ties (enrollment=1 > escalation=2 > baseline=3)
- **Tertiary**: `event_id` for final tie-breaking (deterministic)

### Rehire and Lifecycle Handling
- **New hires**: Seeded from baseline in any year if not in previous_year_state
- **Rehires**: Detected via baseline presence + prior termination; use baseline rate (could be enhanced to restore prior rate)
- **Terminations**: `is_active = FALSE` when termination_date <= as_of_month
- **Monthly precision**: State changes tracked at month level for payroll integration

### DuckDB Compatibility
- **JSON arrays**: Use `to_json([value])` instead of `JSON_ARRAY()`
- **No partitioning**: DuckDB ignores `partition_by`; rely on year filtering
- **No indexes**: DuckDB ignores index configs; optimize via WHERE clauses
- **Incremental**: `delete+insert` strategy works reliably with unique_key

### Audit and Determinism
- **source_event_ids**: JSON array of contributing event UUIDs
- **state_version**: DENSE_RANK over change points per employee (deterministic)
- **applied_at**: Deterministic, derived from effective_date
- **last_updated_at**: Non-deterministic system timestamp (acceptable for audit)

This implementation story is the technical heart of the Epic E036 solution. The model properly handles temporal state accumulation without creating circular dependencies, while maintaining monthly precision and comprehensive audit trails.
