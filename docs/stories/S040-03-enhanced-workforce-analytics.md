# Story S040-03: Enhanced Workforce Analytics

**Epic**: E040 - Employer Contribution Enhancements
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancement
**Points**: 4
**Owner**: Data / Platform
**Priority**: Medium (After MVP)
**Prerequisites**: E039 - Employer Contribution Integration (MVP)

---

## Story Description

**As a** financial analyst
**I want** core contributions in the workforce snapshot
**So that** I can calculate total employer retirement costs and complete compensation packages

## Background

Building on S039-04 (Match Integration), this story completes the employer contribution integration by adding core (non-elective) contributions to the workforce snapshot. Core contributions are:

- **Independent of employee behavior**: Not tied to employee deferrals like match
- **Plan sponsor driven**: Employer decides contribution amounts/rates
- **Often significant costs**: Can represent 1-5% of total payroll
- **Required for complete modeling**: Essential for accurate cost projections

With both match and core contributions integrated, the workforce snapshot becomes the comprehensive source for all retirement plan costs and total compensation analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- âœ… **Core Amount Integration**: Add `employer_core_amount` column to workforce snapshot
- âœ… **Eligibility Flag Integration**: Add `core_eligible_flag` column
- âœ… **Total Employer Contributions**: Add `total_employer_contributions` summary column
- âœ… **Complete Cost View**: Total plan contributions (employee + employer) with `total_plan_contributions` column
- âœ… **Data Consistency**: Core amounts align with core calculation model

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… **Efficient Integration**: Build on existing match integration pattern
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Minimize additional join overhead
- âœ… **Index Strategy**: Support analytical queries on contribution data
- âœ… **Incremental Compatibility**: Maintain existing incremental strategy
- âœ… **Schema Tests**: Comprehensive validation of new columns

### Business Requirements
- âœ… **Complete Cost Model**: All employer retirement costs in single view
- âœ… **Analytical Power**: Enable comprehensive cost analysis and projections
- âœ… **Budget Integration**: Support annual budgeting and forecasting
- âœ… **Audit Readiness**: Complete audit trail through to source calculations

## Technical Design

### Workforce Snapshot Extensions

#### Additional New Columns
```sql
-- Add to fct_workforce_snapshot.sql (building on S039-04)
-- Core contribution data
employer_core_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
core_eligible_flag BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
core_rate_applied DECIMAL(6,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0000,
core_percentage_of_comp DECIMAL(6,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0000,

-- Summary columns
total_employer_contributions DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
total_plan_contributions DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
employer_contribution_rate DECIMAL(6,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0000,
```

#### Integration Join Pattern
```sql
-- Core contribution data join
core_data AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    simulation_year,
    core_contribution_amount AS employer_core_amount,
    core_rate AS core_rate_applied,
    CASE
      WHEN eligible_compensation > 0
      THEN core_contribution_amount / eligible_compensation
      ELSE 0
    END AS core_percentage_of_comp
  FROM {{ ref('int_employee_core_contributions') }}
  WHERE simulation_year = {{ simulation_year }}
),

-- Enhanced eligibility data (from S039-02)
eligibility_enhanced AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    simulation_year,
    eligible_for_match AS match_eligible_flag,
    eligible_for_core AS core_eligible_flag
  FROM {{ ref('int_employer_contribution_eligibility') }}
  WHERE simulation_year = {{ simulation_year }}
),
```

#### Final Selection with Complete Integration
```sql
SELECT
  -- Existing workforce snapshot columns (including match from S039-04)
  base.*,

  -- Core contribution integration
  COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0.00) AS employer_core_amount,
  COALESCE(eligibility.core_eligible_flag, FALSE) AS core_eligible_flag,
  COALESCE(core.core_rate_applied, 0.0000) AS core_rate_applied,
  COALESCE(core.core_percentage_of_comp, 0.0000) AS core_percentage_of_comp,

  -- Summary calculations
  (COALESCE(base.employer_match_amount, 0) +
   COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0)) AS total_employer_contributions,

  -- Complete total plan contributions (employee + all employer)
  (COALESCE(base.annual_contribution_amount, 0) +
   COALESCE(match.employer_match_amount, 0) +
   COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0)) AS total_plan_contributions,

  -- Enhanced analytical columns
  (base.employee_gross_compensation +
   COALESCE(base.annual_contribution_amount, 0) +
   COALESCE(match.employer_match_amount, 0) +
   COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0)) AS total_retirement_compensation,

  CASE WHEN COALESCE(base.annual_contribution_amount, 0) > 0
            OR COALESCE(match.employer_match_amount, 0) > 0
            OR COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0) > 0
       THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS plan_participation_flag,

  -- Employer contribution rate (% of compensation)
  CASE
    WHEN base.employee_gross_compensation > 0
    THEN (COALESCE(base.employer_match_amount, 0) +
          COALESCE(core.employer_core_amount, 0)) / base.employee_gross_compensation
    ELSE 0
  END AS employer_contribution_rate

FROM base_workforce_final base
LEFT JOIN match_data match
  ON base.employee_id = match.employee_id
  AND base.simulation_year = match.simulation_year
LEFT JOIN core_data core
  ON base.employee_id = core.employee_id
  AND base.simulation_year = core.simulation_year
LEFT JOIN eligibility_enhanced eligibility
  ON base.employee_id = eligibility.employee_id
  AND base.simulation_year = eligibility.simulation_year
```

## Complete Schema Update

```

### Index Strategy Update
```sql
{{ config(
    indexes=[
        -- Existing indexes
        {'columns': ['simulation_year', 'employee_id'], 'type': 'btree', 'unique': true},
        {'columns': ['level_id', 'simulation_year'], 'type': 'btree'},
        {'columns': ['employment_status', 'simulation_year'], 'type': 'btree'},

        -- Match analysis indexes (from S039-04)
        {'columns': ['match_eligible_flag', 'simulation_year'], 'type': 'btree'},
        {'columns': ['employer_match_amount'], 'type': 'btree'},

        -- Core contribution analysis indexes (new)
        {'columns': ['core_eligible_flag', 'simulation_year'], 'type': 'btree'},
        {'columns': ['employer_core_amount'], 'type': 'btree'},

        -- Total contribution analysis indexes
        {'columns': ['total_employer_contributions'], 'type': 'btree'},
        {'columns': ['total_plan_contributions'], 'type': 'btree'},
        {'columns': ['employer_contribution_rate', 'simulation_year'], 'type': 'btree'}
    ]
) }}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Pre-Aggregation Join Optimization Strategy
```sql
-- Pre-aggregated join pattern combining match and core data
WITH employer_contributions_aggregated AS (
  -- Single CTE combining match and core with pre-computed analytics
  SELECT
    COALESCE(m.employee_id, c.employee_id) AS employee_id,
    COALESCE(m.simulation_year, c.simulation_year) AS simulation_year,

    -- Match data (pre-rounded for performance)
    ROUND(COALESCE(m.employer_match_amount, 0), 2) AS employer_match_amount,
    m.effective_match_rate,
    m.match_percentage_of_comp,
    m.formula_id AS match_formula_used,

    -- Core data (pre-rounded for performance)
    ROUND(COALESCE(c.employer_core_amount, 0), 2) AS employer_core_amount,
    c.core_rate_applied,
    c.core_percentage_of_comp,

    -- Pre-aggregate totals to reduce downstream calculation overhead
    ROUND(COALESCE(m.employer_match_amount, 0) +
          COALESCE(c.employer_core_amount, 0), 2) AS total_employer_contributions,

    -- Pre-compute participation flags for analytics
    CASE WHEN COALESCE(m.employer_match_amount, 0) > 0
              OR COALESCE(c.employer_core_amount, 0) > 0
         THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS has_employer_contributions

  FROM {{ ref('int_employee_match_calculations') }} m
  FULL OUTER JOIN {{ ref('int_employee_core_contributions') }} c
    ON m.employee_id = c.employee_id
    AND m.simulation_year = c.simulation_year
  WHERE COALESCE(m.simulation_year, c.simulation_year) = {{ var('simulation_year') }}
)
```

### Expected Performance Impact
- **Build Time**: <10% additional increase (total <25% vs original)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase due to efficient FULL OUTER JOIN pattern
- **Query Performance**: Enhanced indexes support comprehensive analytics
- **Scalability**: Maintains sub-linear scaling for larger datasets

## Advanced Analytics Examples

### Complete Cost Analysis

WHERE simulation_year BETWEEN 2025 AND 2029
GROUP BY simulation_year
ORDER BY simulation_year;
```

      NULLIF(employee_gross_compensation, 0)) AS avg_deferral_rate,

  -- Employer contributions
  AVG(employer_match_amount) AS avg_employer_match,
  AVG(employer_core_amount) AS avg_employer_core,
  AVG(total_employer_contributions) AS avg_total_employer,

  -- Total retirement
  AVG(total_plan_contributions) AS avg_total_retirement,
  AVG(total_plan_contributions / NULLIF(employee_gross_compensation, 0)) AS avg_retirement_rate,

  -- Total compensation
  AVG(employee_gross_compensation + total_plan_contributions) AS avg_total_comp

FROM {{ ref('fct_workforce_snapshot') }}
WHERE simulation_year = 2025
  AND employment_status = 'active'
GROUP BY level_id
ORDER BY level_id;
```

### Cost Projection Analysis
```sql
-- Multi-year cost projection and growth analysis
WITH yearly_costs AS (

    SUM(employer_core_amount) AS total_core_cost,
    SUM(total_employer_contributions) AS total_employer_cost,
    SUM(total_plan_contributions) AS total_plan_cost
  FROM {{ ref('fct_workforce_snapshot') }}
  WHERE simulation_year BETWEEN 2025 AND 2029
    AND employment_status = 'active'
  GROUP BY simulation_year
)
SELECT
  simulation_year,
  total_payroll,
  total_employer_cost,
  total_plan_cost,

  -- Cost as % of payroll
  ROUND(total_employer_cost / total_payroll * 100, 2) AS employer_cost_pct_payroll,
  ROUND(total_plan_cost / total_payroll * 100, 2) AS total_plan_cost_pct_payroll,

  -- Year-over-year growth
  ROUND((total_employer_cost / LAG(total_employer_cost) OVER (ORDER BY simulation_year) - 1) * 100, 2) AS employer_cost_growth_pct,
  ROUND((total_plan_cost / LAG(total_plan_cost) OVER (ORDER BY simulation_year) - 1) * 100, 2) AS plan_cost_growth_pct

FROM yearly_costs
ORDER BY simulation_year;
```
