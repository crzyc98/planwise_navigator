# Story S013-03: Event Processing Modularization

**Epic**: E013 - Dagster Simulation Pipeline Modularization
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 5 story points
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2024-06-25)

## User Story

**As a** Fidelity PlanAlign Engine developer
**I want** event processing logic extracted into dedicated operations
**So that** complex event model execution and debugging is isolated and reusable

## Background

The current pipeline has significant duplication in event processing:
- Lines 295-386 in `run_year_simulation`
- Lines 932-1026 in `run_multi_year_simulation`

Both contain identical logic for:
- Event model sequence execution (termination → promotion → merit → hiring → new_hire_termination)
- Detailed hiring calculation debug logging (🔍 HIRING CALCULATION DEBUG)
- Formula calculations and logging for hiring decisions

This duplication makes maintenance difficult and violates DRY principles.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Event Models Operation**
   - [ ] Create `run_dbt_event_models_for_year` operation
   - [ ] Execute event models in correct Epic 11.5 sequence
   - [ ] Include comprehensive hiring calculation debug logging
   - [ ] Use the new `execute_dbt_command` utility (from S013-01)
   - [ ] Handle all configuration parameters (year, random_seed, growth rates)

2. **Hiring Debug Logic Preservation**
   - [ ] Maintain exact "🔍 HIRING CALCULATION DEBUG:" logging format
   - [ ] Include all formula calculations and intermediate values
   - [ ] Preserve mathematical precision and rounding behavior
   - [ ] Log all 8 debug metrics (workforce, rates, calculations, formula)

3. **Event Sequence Integrity**
   - [ ] Execute models in exact order: int_termination_events → int_promotion_events → int_merit_events → int_hiring_events → int_new_hire_termination_events
   - [ ] Pass all required variables to each model
   - [ ] Handle errors consistently with current implementation
   - [ ] Maintain exact variable formatting for dbt --vars

### Technical Requirements
1. **Operation Signatures**
```python
@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def run_dbt_event_models_for_year(
    context: OpExecutionContext,
    year: int,
    config: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute event models for a single simulation year with debug logging."""

@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def run_dbt_snapshot_for_year(
    context: OpExecutionContext,
    year: int
) -> None:
    """Execute dbt snapshot for year-end workforce state."""
```

2. **Configuration Handling**
   - [ ] Accept full config dictionary with all simulation parameters
   - [ ] Extract required values: random_seed, target_growth_rate, termination rates
   - [ ] Build proper dbt variables dictionary for each model
   - [ ] Handle full_refresh flag appropriately

3. **Debug Calculation Logic**
   - [ ] Calculate workforce count (baseline vs previous year logic)
   - [ ] Apply exact formula from int_hiring_events.sql
   - [ ] Use proper rounding: `math.ceil()` for terminations and hires, `round()` for new hire terminations
   - [ ] Log all intermediate calculations with identical format

## Implementation Details

### Current Duplicated Code Pattern
**Lines 946-1014 (run_multi_year_simulation) duplicate lines 310-376 (run_year_simulation)**:

```python
# Add detailed logging for hiring calculation before running int_hiring_events
if model == "int_hiring_events":
    context.log.info("🔍 HIRING CALCULATION DEBUG:")
    conn = duckdb.connect(str(DB_PATH))
    try:
        # Calculate workforce count
        if year == start_year:  # Different logic in each function!
            workforce_count = conn.execute(
                "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM int_baseline_workforce WHERE employment_status = 'active'"
            ).fetchone()[0]
        else:
            workforce_count = conn.execute(
                "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM int_workforce_previous_year WHERE employment_status = 'active'"
            ).fetchone()[0]

        # ... identical formula calculations ...
        # ... identical logging statements ...
```
