# Epic: Implement Hazard-Based Termination Selection

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: WF-001
**Epic Title**: Unified Hazard-Based Architecture for Workforce Termination Events
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 sprints
**Business Value**: High

## Business Problem

PlanWise Navigator currently has a **significant architectural inconsistency** in its workforce modeling system. While promotions and merit increases use sophisticated hazard-based probability models that account for individual employee characteristics (age, tenure, level), termination events use simple quota-based randomization that ignores these risk factors.

This inconsistency creates several business problems:

1. **Unrealistic Simulation Results**: Cannot model realistic turnover patterns where new employees have higher attrition rates
2. **Limited Strategic Planning**: Unable to simulate targeted retention strategies based on employee risk profiles
3. **Architectural Debt**: Sophisticated termination hazard infrastructure exists but is completely unused
4. **Compliance Risk**: Inconsistent modeling approaches reduce confidence in regulatory and audit scenarios

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
- **Hazard Calculation Model**: `int_hazard_termination.sql` already calculates individual termination probabilities
- **Age-Based Multipliers**: 25-34 age group (1.3x), 45-54 age group (1.6x), etc.
- **Tenure-Based Multipliers**: New employees <2 years (1.8x), experienced 10+ years (0.4x)
- **Mathematical Foundation**: `termination_rate = base_rate * age_multiplier * tenure_multiplier`

### Current Implementation Gap ❌
- **Selection Logic**: `int_termination_events.sql` uses quota-based selection, ignoring hazard calculations
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Terminations don't follow the same pattern as promotions/merit
- **Missed Business Value**: Cannot leverage sophisticated risk modeling for retention planning

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Architectural Consistency**: Align termination selection with hazard-based approach used by other events
2. **Modeling Accuracy**: Enable realistic simulation of demographic-based turnover patterns
3. **Strategic Planning**: Support retention strategy modeling based on employee risk profiles
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure consistent, auditable modeling approaches across all events

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: 100% of workforce events use hazard-based selection methodology
- **Business**: Simulation results show realistic turnover patterns (higher new hire attrition)
- **Validation**: Aggregate termination rates match configuration targets within 2% tolerance
- **Performance**: No degradation in simulation runtime or reproducibility

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Connection
Connect existing hazard calculation infrastructure to termination event selection logic

### Phase 2: Selection Logic Refactoring
Replace quota-based selection with probability-based selection matching promotion pattern

### Phase 3: Configuration Enhancement
Add hazard-specific configuration parameters for fine-tuning termination probabilities

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing
Comprehensive testing to ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and performance

### Phase 5: Documentation & Training
Update documentation and provide guidance for configuration management

## Technical Architecture

### Current Architecture (Problematic)
```
int_hazard_termination.sql (calculates probabilities) ❌ NOT CONNECTED
                                                      ↓
int_termination_events.sql (uses quota selection) ←── ARCHITECTURAL GAP
```

### Target Architecture (Unified)
```
int_hazard_termination.sql (calculates probabilities) ✅ CONNECTED
                                                      ↓
int_termination_events.sql (uses hazard probabilities) ← CONSISTENT PATTERN
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Simulation Changes**: Comprehensive testing ensures no unintended result changes
- **Performance Impact**: Hazard-based selection may be slightly slower; monitoring required
- **Configuration Complexity**: Clear documentation and validation rules prevent misuse

### Business Risks
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Demonstrate clear value through improved modeling accuracy
- **Change Management**: Gradual rollout with comprehensive testing and validation
- **Reproducibility**: Maintain deterministic randomization patterns for audit compliance

### Internal Dependencies
- **Existing Code**: `int_hazard_termination.sql` (already exists)
- **dbt Models**: `int_termination_events.sql` (requires modification)
- **Configuration**: `simulation_config.yaml` (requires enhancement)
