# Workforce Snapshot Architecture Validation Report

## Executive Summary

### Overview
This report documents the validation process and results for the workforce snapshot architecture refactoring in PlanWise Navigator. The refactoring transforms a monolithic `fct_workforce_snapshot` model into a modular chain of intermediate snapshot models, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.

### Summary of Changes
- **Original Architecture**: Single monolithic `fct_workforce_snapshot` model handling all event applications and calculations
- **New Architecture**: Modular chain of intermediate models:
  - `int_snapshot_base` → `int_snapshot_termination` → `int_snapshot_promotion` → `int_snapshot_merit` → `int_snapshot_hiring`
  - `fct_workforce_snapshot` now focuses solely on final calculations and formatting

### Validation Results
- **Overall Status**: [PENDING/PASSED/FAILED]
- **Contract Compatibility**: [Status]
- **Dependency Compatibility**: [Status]
- **Behavior Consistency**: [Status]
- **Performance Impact**: [Status]

### Recommendations
[High-level go/no-go recommendation based on validation results]

## Architecture Changes

### Detailed Description

The refactoring introduces a chain of intermediate models that sequentially apply different types of workforce events:

1. **int_snapshot_base**: Establishes the foundational employee data from previous year
2. **int_snapshot_termination**: Applies termination events to update employment status
3. **int_snapshot_promotion**: Processes promotion events with level and compensation changes
4. **int_snapshot_merit**: Applies merit increases to compensation
5. **int_snapshot_hiring**: Adds new hires to the workforce
6. **fct_workforce_snapshot**: Performs final calculations and formatting

### Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each model has a single, clear responsibility
- **Better Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific event application steps
- **Clearer Data Lineage**: Event application flow is explicit and traceable

### Potential Risks
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional model layers may increase execution time
- **Dependency Complexity**: More models in the dependency graph
- **Migration Effort**: Existing dependencies need validation
- **Incremental Strategy**: Must ensure incremental builds work correctly

## Validation Methodology

### Approach
A systematic validation approach was implemented to ensure the refactored architecture produces identical results to the original implementation while maintaining compatibility with all dependent models.

### Test Categories

1. **Contract Verification**
   - Schema structure validation
   - Data type consistency checks
   - Column presence verification
   - dbt contract test execution

2. **Dependency Compatibility**
   - SCD snapshot models
   - Mart models (compensation growth, policy optimization)
   - Monitoring models
   - Circular dependency resolution

3. **Behavior Validation**
   - Employee count consistency
   - Compensation calculation accuracy
   - Event application correctness
   - Band calculation validation

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Execution time comparison
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Incremental build validation
   - Scalability assessment

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Multi-year simulation consistency
   - Year-over-year transitions
   - Cold start scenarios
   - Error handling

### Tools and Scripts
- `scripts/validate_snapshot_refactor.py`: Automated validation orchestration
- `scripts/compare_snapshot_behavior.sql`: SQL-based behavior comparison
- `tests/integration/test_snapshot_architecture_compatibility.py`: Comprehensive pytest suite
- Existing integration test suites for regression testing

### Success Criteria
