## Usage Examples

### Basic Resource Management
```python
from navigator_orchestrator.resource_manager import ResourceManager

# Create resource manager with configuration
resource_manager = ResourceManager(config=resource_config)
resource_manager.start_monitoring()

# Monitor operation execution
with resource_manager.monitor_execution("my_operation", expected_threads=4):
    # Your operation here
    pass

# Get resource recommendations
optimal_threads, reason = resource_manager.optimize_thread_count(
    current_threads=4,
    context={"stage": "foundation"}
)
```

### Integration with PipelineOrchestrator
Resource management is automatically enabled when configured:

```yaml
orchestrator:
  threading:
    resource_management:
      enabled: true
      # ... other settings
```

The orchestrator will automatically:
- Start resource monitoring at initialization
- Monitor each stage execution with resource tracking
- Adjust thread counts based on system performance
- Clean up resources at completion
