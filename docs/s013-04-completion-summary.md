# S013-04: Snapshot Management Operation - Completion Summary

## Overview
**Story**: S013-04 - Snapshot Management Operation
**Epic**: E013 - Dagster Simulation Pipeline Modularization
**Completion Date**: June 25, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## Implemented Solution

### Core Operation: `run_dbt_snapshot_for_year`

Created a centralized snapshot management operation in `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py` that handles all dbt snapshot operations across different simulation contexts.

**Function Signature:**
```python
@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def run_dbt_snapshot_for_year(
    context: OpExecutionContext,
    year: int,
    snapshot_type: str = "end_of_year"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### Supported Snapshot Types

1. **`end_of_year`** (default): Final workforce state after all events
2. **`previous_year`**: Historical snapshot for year-1 (multi-year dependency)
3. **`recovery`**: Rebuild missing snapshot during validation

### Key Features Implemented

#### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Validation**
- Pre-execution validation based on snapshot type
- Post-execution verification of snapshot creation
- Snapshot type parameter validation with clear error messages

#### ‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
- Graceful failure with structured return values
- Database connection cleanup (proper `conn.close()` calls)
- Non-blocking error handling (returns failure dict instead of raising)

#### ‚úÖ **Integration with Existing Utilities**
- Uses `execute_dbt_command` utility from S013-01
- Follows same DuckDB connection patterns as existing code
- Maintains consistency with current logging and error handling

#### ‚úÖ **Structured Return Values**
```python
{
    "year": int,
    "snapshot_type": str,
    "records_created": int,
    "success": bool,
    "description": str,
    "error": str  # Only present on failure
}
```

## Code Quality & Testing

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- **13 test methods** covering all functionality
- **Unit tests** for success/failure scenarios
- **Integration tests** for multi-year workflows
- **Edge case testing** for error conditions
- **Parametrized tests** for all snapshot types

### ‚úÖ **Validation Framework**
- **6 validation checks** in `validate_s013_04.py`
- Function signature verification
- Implementation analysis with AST parsing
- Integration compatibility validation
- Dagster decorator validation
- Error handling robustness checks

### ‚úÖ **Code Quality**
- **100% validation passing** - all checks green ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive docstring with examples
- Type annotations throughout
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

## Extracted Duplication

The operation centralizes snapshot logic that was previously scattered across:

1. **Lines 1028-1034**: Previous year snapshot in multi-year simulation
2. **Lines 1067-1073**: Current year snapshot in multi-year simulation
3. **Lines 585-591**: Workforce snapshot in single-year simulation

**Total Lines Extracted**: ~20 lines of duplicated snapshot logic
**Code Deduplication**: Eliminates 3 separate snapshot implementations

## Integration Points

### Ready for Integration With:
- **S013-05**: Single-year simulation refactoring (can replace lines 585-591)
- **S013-06**: Multi-year simulation transformation (can replace lines 1028-1034, 1067-1073)

### Dependencies Satisfied:
- **S013-01**: Uses `execute_dbt_command` utility ‚úÖ
- **Existing Pipeline**: Compatible with current DuckDB and dbt patterns ‚úÖ

## Performance & Reliability

### ‚úÖ **Performance**
- Maintains existing performance characteristics
- No additional overhead beyond modularization
- Efficient database connection management

### ‚úÖ **Reliability**
- Comprehensive error handling prevents pipeline failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Validation ensures data integrity before and after operations

## Next Steps

With S013-04 completed, the pipeline now has all foundational utility operations needed for the major refactoring work:

- **S013-05**: Refactor single-year simulation using new modular components
- **S013-06**: Transform multi-year simulation into pure orchestrator
- **S013-07**: Comprehensive validation of refactored pipeline
- **S013-08**: Documentation updates and cleanup

The snapshot management operation is **production-ready** and can be immediately integrated into the existing pipeline or used in the upcoming refactoring stories.
