# S072-01 Completion Update - 2025-07-11

## Summary

Successfully completed Story S072-01: Core Event Model & Pydantic v2 Architecture, establishing the foundational unified event model for PlanWise Navigator's DC plan functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **New Event Model** (`config/events.py`)
   - Unified `SimulationEvent` class with Pydantic v2
   - Required context fields: `scenario_id`, `plan_design_id`, `source_system`
   - EventFactory pattern for type-safe event creation
   - Automatic UUID and timestamp generation

2. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/unit/test_simulation_event.py`)
   - 20 test cases with 100% pass rate
   - Performance benchmarks validated
   - Field validation and serialization coverage

3. **Documentation** (`docs/implementation/S072-01-implementation.md`)
   - Complete implementation guide
   - Architecture decisions documented
   - Integration patterns for future stories

### Documentation Updates

1. **Epic E021 Documentation** (`docs/epics/E021_dc_plan_data_model.md`)
   - Added Epic E021-A section showing S072-01 completion
   - Updated story breakdown with current status
   - Marked S072-01 as COMPLETED with implementation details

2. **Story Documentation** (`docs/stories/S072-01-core-event-model-pydantic-v2.md`)
   - Added COMPLETED status with date and commit reference
   - Updated Definition of Done with checkmarks
   - Added Implementation Summary section with delivered components

3. **CLAUDE.md Updates**
   - Added Unified Event Model section under Event Sourcing Architecture
   - Documented new SimulationEvent class and EventFactory pattern
   - Updated directory layout to include new `config/events.py` file
   - Added performance characteristics (<5ms validation, 1000 events/sec)

## Performance Results

- **Event Creation**: 1000 events in < 1 second ✓
- **Serialization**: 100 events in < 0.1 seconds ✓
- **Validation**: < 5ms per event (target < 10ms) ✓
- **Memory**: < 100MB for 10K events ✓

## Next Steps

The foundation is now ready for subsequent stories in Epic E021-A:

- **S072-02**: Workforce Event Integration (3 points)
- **S072-03**: Core DC Plan Events (5 points)
- **S072-04**: Plan Administration Events (5 points)
- **S072-05**: Loan & Investment Events (3 points)
- **S072-06**: Performance & Validation Framework (8 points)
- **S072-07**: ERISA Compliance Review & Documentation (3 points)
