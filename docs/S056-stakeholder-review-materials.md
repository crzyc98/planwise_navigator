## 2. Business Requirements Validation

### 2.1 Current State Issues (S055 Audit Findings)
- **Oversimplified Patterns**: Current 50/50 Jan/July split doesn't reflect real business practices
- **Hard-coded Logic**: No flexibility for different business scenarios or industries
- **Audit Risk**: Unrealistic patterns undermine simulation credibility
- **Analytics Distortion**: Compensation growth calculations affected by artificial clustering

### 2.2 Proposed Solution Benefits
**Realistic Monthly Distribution**:
```
January: 28%    - Calendar year alignment, budget implementation
April: 18%      - Merit increase cycles, Q2 budget implementation
July: 23%       - Fiscal year starts, educational institutions
October: 8%     - Federal fiscal year, corporate cycles
Other months: 23% - Distributed across remaining months
```

**Key Improvements**:
- **Industry Research-Based**: Patterns derived from HR best practices and compensation surveys
- **Configurable Framework**: Support for different business scenarios and future requirements
- **Audit-Ready**: Defensible timing patterns with complete business justification
- **Zero Risk Rollout**: Backward compatible with gradual opt-in capability

## 3. Technical Approach Summary

### 3.1 Solution Architecture
**Dual-Mode System**:
- **Legacy Mode**: Maintains current 50/50 behavior (default for backward compatibility)
- **Realistic Mode**: Hash-based algorithm produces industry-aligned distribution
- **Configuration Control**: Simple parameter switch between modes

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Default to legacy mode, explicit opt-in to realistic timing
- **Hash-Based Algorithm**: Deterministic but realistic distribution using two-stage selection
- **Performance Optimized**: <5% overhead, suitable for 10K+ employee simulations

### 3.2 Configuration Framework
```yaml
# Simple configuration to enable realistic timing
raise_timing:
  methodology: "realistic"  # Switch from "legacy" to "realistic"
  distribution_profile: "general_corporate"
  validation_tolerance: 0.02  # ±2% accuracy requirement
```

**Configuration Benefits**:
- **Risk-Free Default**: No changes required for existing simulations
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test realistic timing on subset of simulations
- **Future Extensibility**: Framework supports industry-specific patterns
- **Validation Built-In**: Automatic distribution accuracy checking

- Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and performance tests
- Legacy mode as permanent fallback option

**Business Risk Mitigation**:
- Industry research documentation supports timing patterns
- Configuration-controlled rollout enables testing and validation
