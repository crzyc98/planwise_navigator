# Epic E038: Navigator Orchestrator Refactoring & Modularization

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planned
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 39 Story Points (4 weeks)
**Dependencies**: None
**Epic Owner**: Development Team

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Epic Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
The current `run_multi_year.py` orchestrator has grown to 1,012 lines of monolithic code that handles configuration, database management, dbt execution, registry management, pipeline orchestration, reporting, and CLI operations. This creates several critical issues:

- **Maintainability**: Single file with 8+ distinct responsibilities
- **Testability**: Tightly coupled functions difficult to unit test
- **Extensibility**: Adding features requires modifying the monolithic script
- **Code Quality**: Complex interdependencies and repeated patterns
- **Developer Experience**: New team members struggle with the large codebase

### **Solution Approach**
Refactor `run_multi_year.py` into a clean, modular `navigator_orchestrator` package with focused modules following single-responsibility principles. Transform the monolithic architecture into a well-structured, testable, and maintainable orchestration system.

### **Business Value**
- **50% reduction in maintenance effort** through modular design
- **Faster feature development** with clear separation of concerns
- **Improved reliability** through comprehensive testing coverage
- **Better developer onboarding** with focused, understandable modules
- **Enterprise-grade architecture** supporting future scalability

---

## ðŸ”­ **Scope and Nonâ€‘Goals**

### **In Scope**
- Modularization of orchestration concerns (config, dbt, registries, pipeline, reporting, validation, CLI).
- Backwardsâ€‘compatible public API and CLI for multiâ€‘year runs.
- Eventâ€‘sourced alignment: preserve immutable event lineage and reproducibility.

### **Nonâ€‘Goals**
- Changing business logic of dbt models or their contracts.
- Altering database schemas or event table immutability.
- Introducing crossâ€‘cutting refactors beyond the orchestrator boundary.

### **Assumptions/Constraints**
- Execution targets DuckDB at `simulation.duckdb`; avoid IDE locks during runs.
- dbt commands run only from `/dbt`; use `{{ ref() }}` and avoid `SELECT *`.
- Network installs are restricted; any new Python deps must be optional or guarded.

## ðŸ“‹ **Technical Architecture**

### **Proposed Package Structure**
```
navigator_orchestrator/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Public API exports (run_multi_year, run_year)
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py           # YAML loading, validation, dbt variable mapping
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt_runner.py       # dbt command orchestration with error handling
â”œâ”€â”€ registries.py       # enrollment_registry & deferral_escalation_registry
â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline.py         # Year flow orchestration and dependency management
â”œâ”€â”€ reports.py          # Year-end audit reports and multi-year summaries
â”œâ”€â”€ validation.py       # Data quality checks and business rule validation
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py            # ExecutionMutex, database connections, timing utilities
â””â”€â”€ cli.py              # Thin CLI entrypoint with argument parsing
```

### **Module Responsibilities**

| Module | Lines | Responsibilities | Dependencies |
|--------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| `config.py` | ~150 | YAML loading, Pydantic validation, dbt var mapping | `yaml`, `pydantic`, `pathlib` |
| `dbt_runner.py` | ~120 | dbt subprocess execution, command templating, error handling | `subprocess`, `json` |
| `registries.py` | ~200 | Registry creation/updates, SQL generation, state management | Database utilities |
| `pipeline.py` | ~180 | Year orchestration, model sequencing, error recovery | All modules |
| `reports.py` | ~220 | Audit queries, formatted reporting, multi-year analytics | Database utilities |
| `validation.py` | ~100 | Data quality rules, threshold validation, anomaly detection | Database utilities |
| `utils.py` | ~80 | Database connections, mutex, timing, logging utilities | `duckdb`, threading |
| `cli.py` | ~60 | Argument parsing, progress display, environment validation | `click`, `rich` |

### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Focused Responsibilities**: Each module has a single, clear purpose
- **Interface-Driven Design**: Clean APIs between modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules receive dependencies, not global state
- **Error Isolation**: Failures contained within module boundaries
- **Testing Strategy**: Each module independently unit testable

### **Public API Surface**
```python
# navigator_orchestrator/__init__.py
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional, Sequence

class MultiYearReport: ...  # Structured summary object for auditing

def run_year(config_path: Path, year: int, selectors: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None) -> dict: ...

def run_multi_year(
    config_path: Path,
    start_year: int,
    end_year: int,
    selectors: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
) -> MultiYearReport: ...
```

### **Configuration Schema (excerpt)**
```yaml
scenario_id: "S001"
plan_design_id: "P2024"
years:
  start: 2021
  end: 2025
dbt:
  target: dev
  threads: 4
  selectors: ["state:modified+"]
validation:
  row_drift_tolerance: 0.005  # 0.5%
  require_pk_uniqueness: true
locks:
  enable_mutex: true
duckdb_path: "simulation.duckdb"
```

### **Eventâ€‘Sourcing Alignment**
- Preserve immutable `fct_yearly_events`; no inâ€‘place mutation.
- Maintain unified `SimulationEvent` semantics, carrying `scenario_id` and `plan_design_id` context through every stage.
- Orchestrator must not break eventâ†’state lineage used by marts/accumulators; all state must be reproducible from events.
- Reporting modules consume event streams and snapshots without side effects.
