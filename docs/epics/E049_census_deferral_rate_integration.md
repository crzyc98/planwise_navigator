# Epic E049: Census Deferral Rate Integration

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Census Deferral Rate Integration Deployed
**Epic Owner**: Data/Modeling Team
**Business Impact**: High - Eliminates unrealistic 6% clustering, enables natural deferral distributions
**Technical Debt**: Medium - Fixes hard-coded fallbacks, improves event-sourcing consistency
**Related Epics**: E023 (Enrollment), E035 (Escalation), E036 (Deferral State), E042 (Architecture Fix)

## Problem Statement

The current deferral rate system exhibits unrealistic behavior that doesn't reflect real participant choices:

### Critical Issues
1. **Artificial 6% Mass**: ~96% of pre-enrolled employees defaulted to hard-coded 6% rate
2. **Ignored Census Data**: System doesn't use actual census deferral rates (avg 7.2%, range 0-15%)
3. **Lost Fractional Precision**: Census rates like 1.3%, 2.3%, 3.9% reduced to 6% clustering
4. **Configuration Mismatch**: Auto-enrollment default at 6% instead of realistic 2%
5. **Broken Event Trail**: Pre-enrolled rates not event-sourced, breaking auditability

### Business Impact
- **Unrealistic Projections**: 6% clustering doesn't match real 401(k) behavior patterns
- **Lost Analytical Value**: Can't model impact of different default rates or escalation strategies
- **Compliance Risk**: No audit trail for pre-enrolled participant deferral rates
- **Poor User Experience**: Analysts can't rely on realistic distribution modeling

### Root Cause Analysis
```sql
-- Current problematic pattern in int_deferral_rate_state_accumulator_v2.sql (line 186)
0.06 as initial_deferral_rate,  -- Hard-coded 6% for ALL pre-enrolled employees
```

**Census Data Reality**:
- **5,000 employees** with deferral rates: Min 0%, P25 3.8%, Median 7.5%, P75 11.3%, Max 15%
- **Average 7.2%** (realistic for mature 401(k) plans)
- **Natural distribution** with fractional rates (1.3%, 2.3%, 3.9%, etc.)

## Success Criteria

✅ **Primary Goals**:
- Eliminate artificial 6% deferral rate clustering (reduce from 96% to <5%)
- Use actual census deferral rates including fractional percentages (1.3%, 2.3%, etc.)
- Maintain natural distribution matching census statistics (avg 7.2%, median 7.5%)
- Enable realistic auto-enrollment default (2% instead of 6%)

✅ **Technical Requirements**:
- Maintain full event-sourcing architecture with synthetic baseline events
- Preserve existing model interfaces and downstream compatibility
- Performance: <10 second model execution time for 100K employees
- 100% parity between accumulator and contributions models

✅ **Validation Targets**:
- **2025 Distribution**: Avg 7.0-7.5%, median 7.3-7.7% (matches census)
- **2026+ Escalation**: Natural progression with +1% per year for eligible participants
- **Data Quality**: Zero parity mismatches, complete event coverage
- **Audit Trail**: Every deferral rate traceable to specific enrollment or escalation event

## Validation Results: Multi-Year Snapshot (2025–2029)

The following reflects the current simulation outputs after integrating census deferral rates and fixing participation classification. Scope: `auto_enrollment.scope = "new_hires_only"` — only current-year new hires are auto-enrolled; experienced employees are not auto-enrolled and will appear in the "Not Auto" category unless they enroll via separate voluntary flow.

Notes:
- With `new_hires_only` scope, voluntary enrollments are not generated by the engine; counts remain 0 by design. Switch to `all_eligible_employees` or enable voluntary flows to populate that column.
- The “Not Auto” column captures active employees not subjected to auto-enrollment under the configured scope.

## Architecture Overview

### Event-Sourced Census Baseline Approach

Transform census data into synthetic enrollment events to maintain full event-sourcing while preserving actual participant rates:

```

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Synthetic Event Generation**: Census data → enrollment events for full auditability
2. **Rate Preservation**: Maintain exact census rates (0.013 → 1.3%, not 6%)
3. **Event-Driven State**: No hard-coded fallbacks, all rates from event stream
4. **Configuration Control**: Parameterized defaults and caps via dbt variables

    SELECT
        employee_id, effective_date as enrollment_date,
        employee_deferral_rate as initial_deferral_rate,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM effective_date) as enrollment_year,
        'synthetic_baseline' as source
    FROM {{ ref('int_synthetic_baseline_enrollment_events') }}
    WHERE employee_id IS NOT NULL
