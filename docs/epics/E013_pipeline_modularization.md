# Epic E013: Dagster Simulation Pipeline Modularization

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High
**Epic Owner**: Technical Lead
**Start Date**: 2024-06-24
**Actual Completion**: 2025-07-09
**Final Success Rate**: 100% (All 8 stories completed)

## Executive Summary

The current Dagster simulation pipeline contains a monolithic `run_multi_year_simulation` operation of 325+ lines that handles multiple responsibilities including data cleaning, orchestration, dbt command execution, validation, and logging. This creates maintenance burden, code duplication, and testing challenges that impact development velocity and code quality.

This epic will refactor the pipeline into modular, single-responsibility components while preserving identical business logic and simulation sequence as defined in Epic 11.5.

## Business Justification

### Current Pain Points
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Logic changes require updates in multiple locations due to 60% code duplication between single-year and multi-year operations
- **Development Velocity**: Large, complex functions slow down feature development and bug fixes
- **Testing Difficulty**: Monolithic structure makes unit testing and isolation challenging
- **Code Quality**: Repetitive dbt command patterns (15+ identical blocks) violate DRY principles
- **Risk Management**: Large functions increase risk of introducing bugs during modifications

### Business Value
- **Reduced Development Time**: Modular components enable faster feature development and maintenance
- **Improved Code Quality**: Single-responsibility functions with standardized patterns
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to test and validate
- **Team Productivity**: Cleaner codebase improves developer experience and onboarding
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Eliminates architectural debt that could compound over time

### Success Metrics
- **Code Reduction**: 60% reduction in run_multi_year_simulation function size (325 → ~50 lines)
- **Duplication Elimination**: Remove 100% of duplicated logic between single/multi-year operations
- **Testing Coverage**: Achieve >95% unit test coverage on new modular components
- **Performance**: Maintain identical simulation execution time and results
- **Maintainability**: Reduce average time to implement new features by 30%

## Technical Scope

### In Scope
1. **Modularization of run_multi_year_simulation operation**
   - Extract data cleaning logic into dedicated operation
   - Create reusable dbt command executor utility
   - Separate event processing into focused operations
   - Transform main operation into pure orchestrator

2. **Refactoring of run_year_simulation operation**
   - Integrate with new utility functions
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - Maintain existing validation logic

3. **Standardization of dbt command execution**
   - Create centralized dbt command utility
   - Standardize error handling and logging
   - Implement consistent --vars and --full-refresh handling

4. **Testing and validation framework**
   - Unit tests for all new modular components
   - Integration tests to verify identical behavior
   - Performance benchmarking

### Out of Scope
- Changes to simulation business logic or Epic 11.5 sequence
- Modifications to dbt models or database schema
- User interface or dashboard changes
- Configuration structure changes

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies identified
- Internal dependency on existing dbt models and database structure
- Requires coordination with any concurrent Epic 11.5 simulation changes
