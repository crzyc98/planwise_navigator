# Epic E057: New Hire Termination and Proration Fix

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** High
**Epic Type:** Bug Fix
**Estimated Points:** 8
**Created:** 2025-01-26
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-25

## Problem Statement

Critical issues with new hire termination events and prorated compensation calculations are causing:

1. **Invalid termination dates**: New hires terminated in the year following the simulation year (up to March 2026).
2. **Impossible scenarios**: Termination dates occurring before hire dates (up to 347 days prior).
3. **Incorrect compensation**: Proration off by one day for terminated employees.
4. **Financial impact**: Full‑year compensation paid despite early termination.

## Current Impact

### Data Quality Issues
- **20+ employees** with termination dates in 2026 during 2025 simulation.
- **Multiple employees** with termination dates before hire dates.
- **Full‑year compensation** paid to employees who should be prorated.

### Examples
```sql
-- Employee NH_2025_000354
-- Hired: 2025-12-21, Terminated: 2025-01-08 (347 days BEFORE hire!)
-- Getting full compensation: $64,476.16 instead of prorated amount

-- Employee NH_2025_000893
-- Hired: 2025-06-13, Terminated: 2026-01-02 (wrong year!)
-- Getting full compensation: $138,174.72 instead of ~$107,000 prorated
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Termination Date Generation Logic (`int_new_hire_termination_events.sql:69–72`)
```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC CODE
LEAST(
  ft.hire_date + INTERVAL (30 + (CAST(SUBSTR(ft.employee_id, -3) AS INTEGER) % 240)) DAY,
  CAST('{{ simulation_year + 1 }}-03-31' AS DATE)  -- Allows 2026 dates!
) AS effective_date,
```

**Issues:**
- Termination cap extends to March 31 of the following year.
- Late‑year hires (Nov/Dec) can be terminated in the wrong year.
- No validation that termination date > hire date.

### 2. Data Generation Inconsistency
- Some employees exist in `fct_yearly_events` but missing from intermediate models
- Hire date and termination date use different ID parsing logic
- Creates impossible date combinations

### 3. Prorated Compensation Calculation (`fct_workforce_snapshot.sql:543–555`)
```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC CODE
COALESCE(
  next_event_date - INTERVAL 1 DAY,  -- Excludes termination date!
  CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-12-31' AS DATE)
) AS period_end,
```

**Issue:** Subtracts 1 day from next event to avoid overlaps, but incorrectly excludes termination date from compensation period.

## Proposed Solution

### Fix 1: Constrain Termination Dates
Update `int_new_hire_termination_events.sql` to ensure (and use DuckDB‑compatible syntax):
- Termination date >= hire date + 1 day (minimum 1 day employment) when a termination is emitted.
- Termination date <= simulation year end.
- If the minimum termination window crosses year end (e.g., hire on 12‑31), do not emit a termination event for that year.

```sql
-- FIXED CODE (DuckDB/dbt friendly)
-- Candidate termination = hire_date + N days, where N is deterministic from employee_id
-- If candidate > year_end, skip emitting a termination event for this employee/year
WITH bounds AS (
  SELECT
    ft.employee_id,
    ft.hire_date,
    CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-12-31' AS DATE) AS year_end,
    DATEADD('day', 1 + (CAST(SUBSTR(ft.employee_id, -3) AS INTEGER) % 240), ft.hire_date) AS candidate_term
  FROM ft
), filtered AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    hire_date,
    CASE
      WHEN candidate_term > year_end THEN NULL
      WHEN candidate_term <= hire_date THEN DATEADD('day', 1, hire_date)
      ELSE candidate_term
    END AS effective_date
  FROM bounds
)
SELECT * FROM filtered WHERE effective_date IS NOT NULL;
```

Notes:
- Deterministic, reproducible generation preserves event‑sourcing guarantees.
- Avoids creating impossible dates and avoids back‑capping that would violate the ≥ hire_date + 1 rule.

### Fix 2: Correct Prorated Compensation
Update `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` to include termination date in compensation period:

```sql
-- FIXED CODE
CASE
  -- For periods ending with termination, include the termination date
  WHEN LEAD(event_type) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY event_sequence) = 'termination'
    THEN next_event_date  -- include termination date
  -- For other periods, exclude next event to avoid overlap
  ELSE COALESCE(DATEADD('day', -1, next_event_date), CAST('{{ simulation_year }}-12-31' AS DATE))
END AS period_end,
```

### Fix 3: Data Quality Validation
Add dbt tests/queries to detect and block:
- Termination dates before hire dates.
- Termination dates outside simulation year.
- Orphaned employees missing from intermediate models.

Where feasible, encode these as `schema.yml` tests on `int_new_hire_termination_events` and `fct_workforce_snapshot` (e.g., custom tests asserting `termination_date BETWEEN hire_date + 1 AND year_end`).

### Validation Queries
```sql
-- No future terminations
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
WHERE simulation_year = 2025
  AND employment_status = 'terminated'
  AND YEAR(termination_date) > 2025;
-- Expected: 0

-- No terminations before hires
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
WHERE simulation_year = 2025
  AND employee_id LIKE 'NH_2025_%'
  AND termination_date < employee_hire_date;
-- Expected: 0

-- Prorated compensation validation (allow 1-day rounding tolerance)
WITH cmp AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    DATEDIFF('day', employee_hire_date, termination_date) + 1 AS expected_days,
    ROUND(prorated_annual_compensation / NULLIF(current_compensation, 0) * 365) AS actual_days
  FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
  WHERE simulation_year = 2025
    AND employee_id LIKE 'NH_2025_%'
    AND employment_status = 'terminated'
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM cmp
WHERE ABS(expected_days - actual_days) > 1;
-- Expected: 0
```

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies.
- Compatible with existing multi‑year orchestration.
- Does not break existing model contracts.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Behavioral change**: May affect existing terminated employee calculations.
  - **Mitigation**: Validate experienced employee terminations remain unchanged; add snapshot‑level regression checks.
- **Performance**: Minor overhead from validation logic.
  - **Mitigation**: Scope checks to new‑hire flow; use targeted `--select` in dbt.

## Related Issues
- Links to proration concerns in contribution calculations.
- May resolve downstream DC plan contribution calculation errors.
- Supports accurate workforce cost modeling requirements.

## Rollout & Verification
- Run targeted builds: `cd dbt && dbt run --select int_new_hire_termination_events fct_workforce_snapshot`.
- Execute tests: `dbt test --select int_new_hire_termination_events fct_workforce_snapshot`.
- Spot‑check late‑year hires (Dec) to ensure no termination events are emitted when the minimum employment window crosses year end.
- Re‑run multi‑year harness: `python orchestrator_dbt/run_multi_year.py` and review DQ results.

## Work Completed (2025-08-25)

### ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

1. **Updated `int_new_hire_termination_events.sql`**:
   - Added termination bounds checking with `termination_bounds` and `valid_terminations` CTEs
   - Replaced problematic `LEAST(hire_date + INTERVAL(...), simulation_year + 1 + '-03-31')` logic
   - Added deterministic filtering to exclude invalid terminations
   - Applied date constraints ensuring termination >= hire_date + 1 and <= year_end

2. **Updated `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`**:
   - Added `next_event_type` field to `employee_timeline_with_boundaries` CTE
   - Enhanced period_end logic to include termination dates in compensation periods
   - Applied fix to both event periods and baseline period calculations
   - Maintained backward compatibility for non-termination scenarios

3. **Created comprehensive validation framework**:
   - **Schema tests**: Added 3 tests to `dbt/models/marts/schema.yml`
   - **Validation model**: Created `dq_e057_new_hire_termination_validation.sql` with 14 validation rules
   - **Documentation**: Created complete testing and validation guide

### ❌ **Critical Issues Discovered and Resolved**

**VALIDATION FAILURES INITIALLY OCCURRED** (2025-08-25 morning):
- **265 total validation failures** detected by comprehensive validation model
- **Specific example**: Employee `NH_2025_000362` with termination date `2025-01-04` and December hire date
- **96 future termination failures**: Employees with 2026 termination dates in 2025 simulation
- **36 termination-before-hire failures**: Invalid date sequences
- **132 prorated compensation mismatches**: Calculation errors

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** (2025-08-25 afternoon):
The issue was not in `int_new_hire_termination_events.sql` but in the coordination between different termination models. The termination events were being generated by the general `int_termination_events` model, which was applying experienced employee termination logic to new hires without considering their hire dates.

### ✅ **Final Resolution (2025-08-25 afternoon)**

**ACTUAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Updated `int_termination_events.sql`**: Added logic to exclude employees who have new hire events in the same simulation year, preventing experienced employee termination logic from being applied to new hires.

2. **Enhanced coordination**: Ensured termination events are only generated for employees who don't have conflicting hire events in the same year.

3. **Added data quality validation**: Created comprehensive tests to prevent future occurrences of impossible date sequences.

**VALIDATION RESULTS (Final)**:
- ✅ **0 employees** with termination before hire dates
- ✅ **0 terminations** in future years (beyond simulation year)
- ✅ **All date sequences** now logically valid
- ✅ **Prorated compensation** correctly includes termination dates
- ✅ **Event sourcing integrity** maintained with deterministic generation

### 🎉 **Epic Successfully Completed**

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- [x] All new‑hire terminations occur within the simulation year
- [x] No termination dates before hire dates
- [x] Prorated compensation includes termination date for terminated employees
- [x] No termination emitted when minimum window crosses year end
- [x] Full multi‑year simulation completes without invalid dates

## Changes Implemented (Session Summary)

This section documents the concrete code updates made while delivering E057 and stabilizing growth/proration behavior.

- Experienced terminations: excluded current‑year hires from experienced pool
  - File: `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_termination_events.sql`
  - Change: In `active_workforce`, added filter `employee_hire_date < '{{ simulation_year }}-01-01'::DATE` so experienced terminations only sample from prior‑year actives (prevents overlap with new‑hire terminations and restores planned totals).

- New‑hire terminations: pre‑filter valid candidates and select exactly target N
  - File: `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_new_hire_termination_events.sql`
  - Key updates:
    - Compute `days_until_year_end` and a guaranteed in‑year `candidate_termination_date` first.
    - Filter to valid in‑year candidates before selection.
    - Select exactly `expected_new_hire_terminations` using deterministic ordering to meet target.
    - DuckDB syntax fix: replaced `DATEADD` with `hire_date + CAST('<k> days' AS INTERVAL)` for variable offsets.

- Year‑1 vs multi‑year planning baseline
  - File: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_workforce_needs.sql`
  - Change: `current_workforce` now sources:
    - Year 1: `int_baseline_workforce` (avoid counting staging NHs as baseline).
    - Years > 1: `int_employee_compensation_by_year` (previous year snapshot) to drive ongoing hiring/termination targets.

- Identity‑based new‑hire attrition to avoid double rounding
  - File: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_workforce_needs.sql`
  - Change: `expected_new_hire_terminations = total_hires_needed − expected_experienced_terminations − target_net_growth` (clamped at ≥ 0). This enforces the net‑change identity at person‑level and removes first‑year rounding drift.

- Exact per‑level hire allocation (largest remainder)
  - File: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_workforce_needs_by_level.sql`
  - Change: Replaced per‑level `CEIL` with largest‑remainder allocation:
    - `base_hires = FLOOR(total_hires_needed * share)`; distribute remaining hires to levels with largest fractional remainders.
    - Ensures `SUM(hires_needed) = total_hires_needed` exactly; removes +1..+4 drift.

### Rationale and Impact
- Prevents invalid dates and enforces in‑year terminations for new hires (E057 core intent).
- Removes experienced/NH termination overlap, preserving event totals and restoring 3% growth.
- Eliminates first‑year growth overshoot by fixing rounding and allocation edge cases.
- Multi‑year years (2026+) now generate hires/terminations correctly using prior‑year snapshot.

### Verification Steps
- Orchestrator end‑to‑end:
  - `python -m navigator_orchestrator run`
- Targeted dbt run:
  - `cd dbt && dbt run --select int_employee_compensation_by_year int_workforce_needs int_workforce_needs_by_level int_hiring_events int_new_hire_termination_events int_termination_events fct_yearly_events fct_workforce_snapshot`
- Quick queries (DuckDB):
  - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM int_new_hire_termination_events WHERE simulation_year=2025;`  -- matches target
  - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM int_termination_events WHERE simulation_year=2025;`            -- matches target
  - `SELECT SUM(event_type='hire') AS hires, SUM(event_type='termination' AND event_category='experienced_termination') AS exp_terms, SUM(event_type='termination' AND event_category='new_hire_termination') AS nh_terms FROM fct_yearly_events WHERE simulation_year=2025;`
  - Year‑end actives ≈ baseline × 1.03 in 2025; ≈ 3% YoY thereafter.

### Acceptance Notes (Updated)
- 2025 growth rate now lands at 3.0% (not >3%) due to:
  - Identity‑based NH attrition (no double rounding).
  - Largest‑remainder hire allocation sums exactly to `total_hires_needed`.
- Experienced terminations do not include current‑year hires; NH terminations strictly in‑year and ≥ hire_date + 1.
