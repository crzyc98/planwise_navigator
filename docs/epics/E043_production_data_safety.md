# Epic E043: Production Data Safety & Backup System

**Epic Points**: 12
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Duration**: 1 Sprint
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Last Updated**: August 18, 2025

## Epic Story

**As a** production operations team
**I want** automated database backup, credential security, and data protection mechanisms
**So that** we can prevent total data loss and ensure secure operations in production

## Business Context

PlanWise Navigator currently has **zero backup protection** for the simulation database, exposing the organization to complete data loss. With 42,331 events across 9,016 employees representing millions of dollars in compensation data, the risk of catastrophic data loss is unacceptable for production deployment.

This epic establishes enterprise-grade data safety practices including automated backups and atomic operations that prevent data corruption. The implementation follows the principle of "fix what's broken" by addressing the most critical production risk first.

## Critical Production Risks Addressed

- **Total data loss**: No backups of `simulation.duckdb` database
- **Data corruption**: No atomic backup operations
- **Manual recovery**: No automated backup rotation or management

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

### Data Protection
- [x] **Automated backup system** with timestamped copies before each simulation run
- [x] **Backup rotation policy** maintaining last 7 backups with automatic cleanup
- [x] **Atomic backup operations** using temp files and atomic rename
- [x] **Latest symlink** pointing to most recent valid backup

### Configuration Management
- [x] **Configuration validation** with required parameter checking
- [x] **Secure defaults** with example configuration

### Operational Excellence
- [x] **Backup verification** with size and integrity checks
- [x] **Disk space monitoring** with cleanup of old backups
- [x] **Error handling** with rollback on backup failures
- [x] **Documentation** with recovery procedures

## Technical Implementation

### Backup Manager Architecture
```python
# navigator_orchestrator/backup_manager.py
class BackupManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backup_dir = Path("backups")
        self.backup_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

    def create_backup(self) -> Path:
        """Create timestamped backup with atomic operations"""
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
        backup_path = self.backup_dir / f"simulation_{timestamp}.duckdb"

        # Atomic copy with verification
        shutil.copy2("simulation.duckdb", f"{backup_path}.tmp")
        self._verify_backup(f"{backup_path}.tmp")
        Path(f"{backup_path}.tmp").rename(backup_path)

        # Maintain latest symlink
        self._update_latest_link(backup_path)
        self._cleanup_old_backups(keep=7)

        return backup_path
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# navigator_orchestrator/config.py
def validate_configuration():
    """Validate required configuration parameters"""
    required_params = ['DB_PATH', 'LOG_LEVEL']
    config = load_configuration()

    for param in required_params:
        if not config.get(param):
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required configuration parameter: {param}")

    # Validate database path exists
    if not Path(config['DB_PATH']).exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Database file not found: {config['DB_PATH']}")

    return config
```

## Success Metrics

### Data Protection Metrics
- **Backup success rate**: 100% successful backups before simulation runs
- **Backup integrity**: Zero corrupt backups detected
- **Recovery time**: <30 seconds to restore from latest backup
- **Storage efficiency**: Automated cleanup maintains <1GB backup storage

### Configuration Metrics
- **Configuration validation**: 100% startup validation success
- **Database accessibility**: 100% successful database connection validation

### Operational Metrics
- **Backup automation**: Zero manual backup operations required
- **Documentation coverage**: Complete runbook with all recovery procedures
- **Disk space management**: Automated cleanup preventing disk full

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Backup corruption**: Mitigated by integrity verification and atomic operations
- **Disk space exhaustion**: Mitigated by automated cleanup and monitoring
- **Backup performance**: Mitigated by incremental backup strategy for large databases

### Operational Risks
- **Manual errors**: Mitigated by full automation and clear procedures
- **Recovery complexity**: Mitigated by simple restore commands and documentation
- **Configuration errors**: Mitigated by startup validation and clear error messages

## Definition of Done

- [x] **Automated backup system** creating timestamped backups before each run
- [x] **Backup verification** confirming integrity of all backup files
- [x] **Configuration validation** preventing startup with missing parameters
- [x] **Recovery procedures** documented with specific commands
- [x] **Testing completed** with backup/restore cycle validation
- [x] **Documentation** including troubleshooting and maintenance procedures

## Implementation Commands

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Create backup infrastructure
mkdir -p backups logs

# 2. Setup configuration
cat > config.yaml << EOF
DB_PATH: simulation.duckdb
LOG_LEVEL: INFO
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS: 7
EOF

# 3. Add to .gitignore
echo "backups/" >> .gitignore

# 4. Test backup system
python -c "
from navigator_orchestrator.backup_manager import BackupManager
bm = BackupManager()
backup_path = bm.create_backup()
print(f'Backup created: {backup_path}')
"
```

### Recovery Example
```bash
# Emergency restore from latest backup
cp backups/latest.duckdb simulation.duckdb

# Restore from specific timestamp
cp backups/simulation_20250818_143022.duckdb simulation.duckdb
```
