## Key Benefits of Breakdown

### Development Benefits
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Faster Feedback**: Core architecture (S072-01) validates before building all payloads
- **Reduced Risk**: Design issues caught early in foundational story
- **Clear Ownership**: Each team owns specific stories matching their expertise

### Planning Benefits
- **Story-Sized Work**: 3-8 points each instead of 18-point monster
- **Incremental Value**: Core events working before extended features
- **Flexible Prioritization**: Could defer S072-05 (loans/investments) if needed
- **Clear Dependencies**: Well-defined blocking relationships

### Quality Benefits
- **Focused Reviews**: Easier to review 3-5 payloads vs 18 in one story
- **Targeted Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests per story
- **Compliance Gates**: ERISA review on complete, validated set

## Implementation Strategy

### Sprint 1 (Foundation)
- **S072-01** & **S072-02** establish core architecture and workforce compatibility
- Platform team focuses on solid Pydantic v2 foundation
- Enables parallel work in Sprint 2

### Sprint 2 (Core Events)
- **S072-03**, **S072-04**, **S072-05** build all 18 event types
- DC Plan team can work on 3 parallel stories
- All depend on S072-01 completion

### Sprint 3 (Enterprise Readiness)
- **S072-06** creates performance/validation framework
- **S072-07** completes ERISA compliance review
- Platform and Compliance teams work in parallel

## Regulatory Compliance

The epic maintains all original regulatory requirements:
- **18 event types** covering complete DC plan lifecycle
- **ERISA compliance** with dedicated story (S072-07)
- **IRS regulation coverage** distributed across relevant stories
- **Enterprise performance** with dedicated validation story (S072-06)

## Success Metrics

### Epic-Level Metrics
- **All 18 event types implemented** with full payload coverage
- **Performance targets met**: ‚â•100K events/sec, ‚â§5s reconstruction
- **ERISA compliance achieved** with benefits counsel approval
- **CI validation**: ‚â•99% schema validation success rate

### Story-Level Tracking
Each story has specific acceptance criteria and success metrics enabling precise progress tracking and quality gates.

## Conclusion

The breakdown transforms an unwieldy 18-point story into a manageable epic with clear work streams, parallel development opportunities, and proper separation of concerns. This approach significantly reduces implementation risk while maintaining the architectural coherence of the original design.

**Next Steps**:
1. Assign stories to teams based on ownership defined above
2. Begin Sprint 1 with S072-01 and S072-02
3. Plan Sprint 2 parallel development for S072-03, S072-04, S072-05
4. Schedule benefits counsel review for S072-07 during Sprint 3

The epic is ready for development with comprehensive specifications, clear dependencies, and realistic timeline expectations.
