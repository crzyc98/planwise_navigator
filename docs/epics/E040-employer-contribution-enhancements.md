**Prerequisites**: E039 - Employer Contribution Integration (MVP)
**Target Start**: After E039 completion

---

## Executive Summary

Enhance the basic employer contribution system (E039) with advanced features for enterprise-grade deployment. This epic builds on the MVP foundation to add sophisticated calculation methods, performance optimizations, comprehensive validation, and audit capabilities.

### Business Impact
- **Advanced plan modeling**: Support complex contribution formulas and eligibility rules
- **Enterprise scalability**: Performance optimizations for large-scale deployments
- **Audit compliance**: Comprehensive tracking and validation for regulatory requirements
- **Operational efficiency**: Sophisticated monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities

---

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

### Required Foundation (E039)
- âœ… Basic eligibility determination (`int_employer_eligibility`)
- âœ… Simple core contribution calculation (`int_employer_core_contributions`)
- âœ… Workforce snapshot integration with employer contribution columns
- âœ… Proven MVP functionality working reliably

### Enhancement Scope
This epic transforms the simple MVP into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready system without breaking existing functionality.

## Technical Enhancement Details

### Advanced Hours Calculation
```sql
-- Business day calculation with holiday exclusion
WITH date_range AS (
  SELECT d::DATE AS business_date
  FROM generate_series(window_start, window_end, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS d
  WHERE EXTRACT(DOW FROM d) NOT IN (0, 6)  -- Exclude weekends
),
business_days AS (
  SELECT dr.business_date
  FROM date_range dr
  LEFT JOIN {{ ref('stg_holidays') }} h
    ON h.holiday_date = dr.business_date
    AND h.holiday_calendar = '{{ var("holiday_calendar", "us_federal") }}'
  WHERE h.holiday_date IS NULL  -- Anti-join for performance
)
SELECT COUNT(*) * {{ var('hours_per_business_day', 8) }} as hours_worked
FROM business_days
```

### Sophisticated Core Contributions
```sql
-- Parameter-driven core contributions with level support
WITH core_rates AS (
  SELECT job_level, parameter_value AS core_rate
  FROM {{ ref('int_effective_parameters') }}
  WHERE parameter_name = 'core_contribution_rate'
    AND event_type = 'CORE_CONTRIB'
),
core_calculations AS (
  SELECT
    ee.employee_id,
    CASE
      WHEN cfa.core_flat_amount IS NOT NULL THEN cfa.core_flat_amount
      ELSE ee.eligible_compensation * COALESCE(cr.core_rate, 0.02)
    END AS core_contribution_amount
  FROM eligible_employees ee
  LEFT JOIN core_rates cr ON ee.level_id = cr.job_level
  LEFT JOIN core_flat_amounts cfa ON ee.level_id = cfa.job_level
)
```

### Advanced Workforce Snapshot
```sql
-- Pre-aggregated employer contributions with enhanced analytics
WITH employer_contributions_aggregated AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(m.employee_id, c.employee_id) AS employee_id,
    ROUND(COALESCE(m.employer_match_amount, 0) +
          COALESCE(c.employer_core_amount, 0), 2) AS total_employer_contributions,
    CASE WHEN COALESCE(m.employer_match_amount, 0) > 0
              OR COALESCE(c.employer_core_amount, 0) > 0
         THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS has_employer_contributions
  FROM {{ ref('int_employee_match_calculations') }} m
  FULL OUTER JOIN {{ ref('int_employee_core_contributions') }} c USING (employee_id, simulation_year)
)
```

## Data Quality Framework

### Validation Models
- `dq_employer_contributions_validation.sql` - Comprehensive validation with realistic thresholds
- `dq_pk_uniqueness_validation.sql` - Primary key validation across all models
- `dq_contribution_cross_validation.sql` - Cross-system consistency checks
- `dq_contribution_performance_monitor.sql` - Performance regression detection

### Health Scoring
```sql
-- Realistic health scoring with 0.5% variance tolerance
CASE
  WHEN error_count = 0 THEN 100
  WHEN error_count <= (total_employees * 0.005) THEN 80  -- Warning threshold
  ELSE 50  -- Failure threshold
END AS health_score
```

## Performance Requirements (Enhanced)

### Scalability Targets
- **100K employees**: <30 seconds for complete contribution pipeline
- **Multi-year simulation**: <5 minutes for 5-year projection
- **Memory usage**: <4GB peak for largest datasets
- **Query performance**: Sub-second analytical queries with composite indexes

### Optimization Strategies
- Pre-aggregated intermediate models to reduce join payload
- Composite indexes on `(employee_id, simulation_year)` for efficient joins
- DuckDB vectorization with `generate_series` and anti-join patterns
- Incremental materialization for large models

---

## Migration from MVP (E039)

### Backward Compatibility
- All E039 models remain functional during enhancement
- New features are additive, not replacement
- Existing analytical queries continue to work
- Graceful degradation if enhancements fail

### Enhancement Path
1. **Phase 1**: Add advanced hours calculation alongside simple version
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance eligibility with reason codes, preserve simple logic
3. **Phase 3**: Add parameter-driven core contributions, keep flat rate as fallback
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize workforce snapshot, preserve basic integration
5. **Phase 5**: Add validation framework and monitoring

### Rollback Strategy
- Each enhancement can be disabled via feature flags
- Original MVP models preserved as fallback
- Database changes are additive (new columns, not modified existing)
