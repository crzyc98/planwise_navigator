## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Existing `orchestrator_mvp` system takes 30-45 minutes for 5-year simulations
2. **Sequential dbt Overhead**: Individual `dbt run` commands create significant startup overhead
3. **Limited Parallelization**: No concurrent execution of independent operations
4. **Mixed Architecture**: Python-SQL hybrid approach with optimization opportunities
5. **Setup Redundancy**: Foundation setup not leveraging our proven 82% faster system

### Architecture Limitations
- **Individual dbt Commands**: 15+ separate `dbt run` executions per year
- **Circular Dependency Workarounds**: Complex helper models force sequential execution
- **Suboptimal SQL**: Complex CTEs rebuilding same data repeatedly
- **Memory Inefficiency**: No DuckDB-specific performance tuning applied
- **Validation Overhead**: Full data quality checks after each operation

### Performance Gaps
- **Foundation Setup**: 49 seconds vs optimized 9 seconds (82% improvement available)
- **Year Processing**: 5-8 minutes vs target 2-3 minutes (60% improvement potential)
- **Multi-Year Coordination**: Sequential blocking vs intelligent overlap opportunities
- **Batch Operations**: Individual commands vs batch execution (75% improvement seen)
