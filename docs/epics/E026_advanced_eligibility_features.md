# Epic E026: Advanced Eligibility Features

## Epic Overview

### Summary
Build advanced eligibility determination features including employee classification rules, entry date processing, age/hours requirements, and complex service calculations. This epic contains all the sophisticated eligibility features that were deferred from the E022 MVP.

### Business Value
- Supports complex plan designs with multiple eligibility rules
- Handles edge cases and regulatory requirements
- Provides complete audit trail for all eligibility determinations
- Enables sophisticated plan modeling and analysis

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Supports all common eligibility rule patterns
- âœ… Handles employee classification exclusions
- âœ… Processes entry dates (immediate, monthly, quarterly)
- âœ… Manages age and hours-based requirements
- âœ… Achieves <100ms response time for point-in-time eligibility queries
- âœ… Supports incremental processing with 95% cache hit rate

### Dependencies
- **Epic E022**: Simple Eligibility Engine (must be completed first)
- Employee demographic data from workforce simulation
- Employment history including hire/term/rehire dates

## User Stories

### Story S022-02: Basic Employee Classification (5 points) ðŸ“…
**Status**: Post-MVP from Epic E022
**As a** plan sponsor
**I want** simple employee type exclusions
**So that** I can exclude interns and contractors from the plan

- Exclude employees by employee_type field (intern, contractor, seasonal)
- Use SQL boolean logic for maximum performance
- Configuration via dbt variables
- Specific exclusion reason tracking (excluded:intern, excluded:contractor)
- Data quality checks for missing/invalid employee types
- Process exclusions in single pass with other eligibility checks
- Generate exclusion events for comprehensive audit trail

**Implementation**: See `/docs/stories/S022-02-basic-employee-classification.md`

### Story S022-03: Entry Date Processing (4 points) ðŸ“…
**Status**: Post-MVP from Epic E022
**As a** payroll administrator
**I want** automatic entry date calculations
**So that** eligible employees start on the correct date

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Calculate immediate entry (same day as eligibility)
- Calculate quarterly entry dates (1/1, 4/1, 7/1, 10/1)
- Calculate monthly entry dates (1st of each month)
- SQL-based implementation for maximum performance
- Configuration via dbt variables
- Handle year boundaries correctly
- Generate entry date events for newly eligible employees

**Implementation**: See `/docs/stories/S022-03-entry-date-processing.md`

### Future Stories (To Be Defined)

#### Story S026-01: Age-Based Eligibility Requirements (6 points) ðŸ“…

**I want** age-based eligibility rules
**So that** we meet plan document requirements

**Future Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support minimum age requirements (18, 21, etc.)
- Vectorized age calculations
- Integration with existing eligibility logic

#### Story S026-02: Hours-Based Eligibility (8 points) ðŸ“…
**As a** benefits administrator
**I want** hours-based eligibility tracking
**So that** part-time employees are properly evaluated

**Future Acceptance Criteria:**
- 1000-hour annual requirements
- YTD hours tracking
- Integration with payroll systems

#### Story S026-03: Complex Service Computation (12 points) ðŸ“…
**As a** compliance officer
**I want** complex service calculations with breaks and rehires
**So that** we meet ERISA requirements for all edge cases

**Future Acceptance Criteria:**
- Hours counting method with 1000-hour threshold and YTD tracking
- Handles breaks in service and rehires with complex rehire credit logic
- Supports "Rule of Parity" for vesting
- Multiple concurrent service calculations (eligibility vs vesting)

#### Story S026-04: Advanced Classification Rules (8 points) ðŸ“…
**As a** plan sponsor
**I want** complex classification rules by multiple attributes
**So that** I have full control over plan participation

**Future Acceptance Criteria:**
- Inclusion/exclusion by location, division, union status
- Statutory exclusions (non-resident aliens)
- Pre-computed classification segments for performance
- Dynamic rule application with effective dating

#### Story S026-05: Eligibility Change Tracking (8 points) ðŸ“…
**As an** audit manager
**I want** complete tracking of eligibility changes
**So that** I can explain any eligibility determination

**Future Acceptance Criteria:**
- Point-in-time eligibility queries with <100ms response
- Eligibility loss scenarios (termination, reclassification)
- Automated compliance reporting
- Event correlation with workforce changes

- ELIGIBILITY event generation
- Simple configuration via `eligibility_waiting_days`

Epic E026 adds the sophisticated features that most enterprise plans require:
- Employee classification and exclusions
- Entry date processing and scheduling
- Age and hours-based requirements
- Complex service calculations and break handling
