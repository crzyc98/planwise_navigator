# Epic E022: Eligibility Engine

## Epic Overview

### Summary
Build a sophisticated eligibility determination engine that evaluates employee eligibility for DC plan participation based on configurable rules including age, service, hours worked, and employee classification.

### Business Value
- Automates complex eligibility calculations reducing manual HR work by 80%
- Ensures 100% compliance with plan document requirements
- Enables modeling of eligibility rule changes to assess participation impact

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Accurately determines eligibility for 100% of employees
- âœ… Supports all common eligibility rule patterns
- âœ… Processes daily eligibility updates for 100K employees in <30 seconds
- âœ… Generates clear audit trail for eligibility determinations
- âœ… Achieves <100ms response time for point-in-time eligibility queries
- âœ… Supports incremental processing with 95% cache hit rate for unchanged employees

### MVP Implementation Approach
This epic is being implemented in phases to deliver value quickly:

**MVP Phase (2 weeks - In Progress)**
- Core eligibility calculator with SQL/dbt implementation (S022-01)
- Basic employee classification with data quality checks (S022-02)
- Entry date processing with monthly/quarterly options (S022-03)
- Integration with orchestrator_mvp framework via dbt models
- Focus on 95% of standard eligibility cases
- **No eligibility events generated** - used as filters only

**Post-MVP Phase (Future)**
- Complex service computation methods
- Breaks in service and rehire logic
- Advanced classification rules (union, location, division)
- Point-in-time eligibility queries
- Incremental processing optimization

## Performance Requirements

| Metric | Requirement | Implementation Strategy |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Daily Processing | <30 seconds for 100K employees | Vectorized DataFrame operations with Pandas/Polars |
| Point-in-Time Queries | <100ms response time | Optimized eligibility snapshots with indexed lookups |
| Cache Hit Rate | 95% for unchanged employees | Service computation caching with employment history tracking |
| Memory Usage | <4GB for 100K employee dataset | Efficient data types and incremental processing |
| Concurrent Scenarios | <2 minutes for 10 parallel scenarios | Process-based parallelism with isolated DataFrames |

## Dependencies
- E021: DC Plan Data Model (must be complete)
- Employee demographic data from workforce simulation
- Employment history including hire/term/rehire dates
- Pandas/Polars for vectorized DataFrame operations
- NumPy for efficient numerical computations
- Pydantic for configuration validation
- DuckDB for optimized analytical queries

## Risks
- **Risk**: Complex service calculation rules for rehires
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive test scenarios
- **Risk**: Performance with daily eligibility checks for 100K+ employees
- **Mitigation**: Incremental processing of changed employees only

## Estimated Effort

### MVP Phase
**Total Story Points**: 19 points (S022-01: 8, S022-02: 5, S022-03: 6)
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks

### Post-MVP Phase
**Total Story Points**: 28 points (remaining stories)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 sprints

### Total Epic
**Total Story Points**: 47 points (reduced from 56 by simplifying MVP, +1 for monthly entry dates)
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 weeks total
