# Epic E022: Eligibility Engine

## Epic Overview

### Summary
Build a simple, configurable eligibility determination engine that evaluates employee eligibility for DC plan participation based on days of service since hire date. This MVP focuses on the most common eligibility pattern: waiting period after hire.

### Business Value
- Automates complex eligibility calculations reducing manual HR work by 80%
- Ensures 100% compliance with plan document requirements
- Enables modeling of eligibility rule changes to assess participation impact

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Accurately determines eligibility for 100% of employees
- âœ… Supports all common eligibility rule patterns
- âœ… Processes daily eligibility updates for 100K employees in <30 seconds
- âœ… Generates clear audit trail for eligibility determinations
- âœ… Achieves <100ms response time for point-in-time eligibility queries
- âœ… Supports incremental processing with 95% cache hit rate for unchanged employees

### MVP Implementation Approach
This epic is being implemented in phases to deliver value quickly:

**MVP Phase (30 minutes - Ultra-Simplified)**
- Core eligibility calculator based on days since hire (S022-01)
- **Eligibility event generation** for newly eligible employees
- Integration with orchestrator_mvp framework via `orchestrator_mvp/run_multi_year.py`
- Configuration-driven waiting period (0-365+ days)

**Post-MVP Phase**
All advanced eligibility features have been moved to **Epic E026: Advanced Eligibility Features**. See `/docs/epics/E026_advanced_eligibility_features.md` for:
- Entry date processing (S022-03)
- Employee classification rules (S022-02)
- Age/hours-based requirements
- Complex service calculations
- Advanced classification rules

## Technical Specifications

### Eligibility Configuration (Centralized)
```yaml
# config/simulation_config.yaml
eligibility:
  waiting_period_days: 365  # 0 for immediate, 365 for 1 year, etc.
```

This integrates with the existing simulation configuration, allowing you to configure eligibility alongside other simulation parameters like growth rates and termination rates.

### Simple Eligibility Implementation
```python
def process_eligibility_for_year(simulation_year: int, config) -> List[Dict]:
    """Simple eligibility processing - just days since hire"""
    eligibility_engine = EligibilityEngine(config)
    return eligibility_engine.generate_eligibility_events(simulation_year)

class EligibilityEngine:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.waiting_period_days = config.eligibility.waiting_period_days

    def generate_eligibility_events(self, simulation_year: int) -> List[Dict]:
        """Generate ELIGIBILITY events for newly eligible employees"""

## Performance Requirements (MVP)

| Metric | Requirement | Implementation Strategy |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Daily Processing | <30 seconds for 100K employees | Simple SQL/dbt operations |
| Event Generation | <5 seconds for newly eligible employees | Lightweight ELIGIBILITY event creation |
| Memory Usage | <1GB for 100K employee dataset | Minimal data requirements (just hire_date) |

**Note**: Advanced performance requirements moved to Epic E026

## Dependencies
- Employee hire date data from workforce simulation
- Event storage infrastructure (fct_yearly_events)
- dbt for SQL-based processing
- DuckDB for analytical queries

## Risks
- **Risk**: Performance with daily eligibility checks for 100K+ employees
- **Mitigation**: Simple SQL-based implementation with minimal complexity

**Note**: Complex risks moved to Epic E026

## Estimated Effort

### MVP Phase
**Total Story Points**: 5 points (S022-01: 5)
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes

### Post-MVP Phase (Epic E026)
**Total Story Points**: 51 points (moved to Epic E026)
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 weeks (see Epic E026)

### Total Epic E022 (MVP Only)
**Total Story Points**: 5 points (S022-01 only)
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes

**Note**: Advanced features moved to Epic E026 (51 additional points)
