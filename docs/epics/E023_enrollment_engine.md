#### Core SQL Models

**int_enrollment_determination.sql** - Main enrollment processing logic:
```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

WITH eligible_population AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref('int_eligibility_determination') }}
    WHERE is_eligible = true
),

demographic_segments AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        CASE
            WHEN current_age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN 'young'
            WHEN current_age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN 'mid_career'
            WHEN current_age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN 'mature'
            ELSE 'senior'
        END as age_segment,

        CASE
            WHEN annual_compensation < 30000 THEN 'low_income'
            WHEN annual_compensation < 50000 THEN 'moderate'
            WHEN annual_compensation < 100000 THEN 'high'
            ELSE 'executive'
        END as income_segment
    FROM eligible_population
),

auto_enrollment_processing AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        true as auto_enrolled,
        entry_date as enrollment_date,
        {{ var('default_deferral_rate') }} as initial_deferral_rate,
        'auto' as enrollment_source,

        -- Calculate opt-out probability using demographic factors
        CASE age_segment
            WHEN 'young' THEN {{ var('opt_out_rate_young') }}
            WHEN 'mid_career' THEN {{ var('opt_out_rate_mid') }}
            WHEN 'mature' THEN {{ var('opt_out_rate_mature') }}
            ELSE {{ var('opt_out_rate_senior') }}
        END *
        CASE income_segment
            WHEN 'low_income' THEN {{ var('opt_out_rate_low_income') }} / {{ var('opt_out_rate_mid') }}
            WHEN 'moderate' THEN 1.0
            WHEN 'high' THEN {{ var('opt_out_rate_high') }} / {{ var('opt_out_rate_mid') }}
            ELSE {{ var('opt_out_rate_executive') }} / {{ var('opt_out_rate_mid') }}
        END as opt_out_probability

    FROM demographic_segments
    WHERE {{ var('auto_enrollment_enabled') }} = true
),

opt_out_determination AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Deterministic random sampling using employee_id as seed
        (ABS(HASH(employee_id || simulation_year)) % 1000000) / 1000000.0 as random_draw,
        random_draw < opt_out_probability as will_opt_out,

        CASE WHEN will_opt_out
            THEN enrollment_date + INTERVAL (ABS(HASH(employee_id || 'opt_out')) % {{ var('opt_out_window_days') }}) DAY
            ELSE null
        END as opt_out_date

    FROM auto_enrollment_processing
),

    SELECT
        *,
        CASE WHEN will_opt_out THEN false ELSE auto_enrolled END as final_enrolled,
        CASE WHEN will_opt_out THEN 0.0 ELSE initial_deferral_rate END as final_deferral_rate,

)

SELECT
    employee_id,

    opt_out_probability,
    will_opt_out,
    opt_out_date,
    random_draw as enrollment_random_seed
FROM final_enrollment_status
```

### Event Generation Integration

Unlike E022 (which uses eligibility as filters), E023 generates actual enrollment events in the event sourcing system:

```sql
-- Generate enrollment events for enrolled participants
INSERT INTO fct_yearly_events
SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as event_id,
    employee_id,
    'enrollment' as event_type,
    enrollment_date as effective_date,
    simulation_year,
    scenario_id,
    plan_design_id,
    json_object(
        'event_type', 'enrollment',
        'plan_id', plan_id,
        'enrollment_date', enrollment_date,
        'pre_tax_contribution_rate', deferral_rate,
        'roth_contribution_rate', 0.0,
        'auto_enrollment', enrollment_source = 'auto',
        'opt_out_window_expires', enrollment_date + INTERVAL {{ var('opt_out_window_days') }} DAY
    ) as payload,
    current_timestamp as created_at
FROM {{ ref('int_enrollment_determination') }}
WHERE enrolled = true;

-- Generate opt-out events for those who opted out
INSERT INTO fct_yearly_events
SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as event_id,
    employee_id,
    'enrollment_change' as event_type,
    opt_out_date as effective_date,
    simulation_year,
    scenario_id,
    plan_design_id,
    json_object(
        'event_type', 'enrollment_change',
        'plan_id', plan_id,
        'change_type', 'opt_out',
        'new_pre_tax_rate', 0.0,
        'previous_rate', {{ var('default_deferral_rate') }}
    ) as payload,
    current_timestamp as created_at
FROM {{ ref('int_enrollment_determination') }}
WHERE will_opt_out = true;
```

### Performance Optimizations

Following the E022 pattern:

1. **Vectorized Operations**: All probability calculations use SQL CASE statements for maximum DuckDB optimization
2. **Deterministic Randomness**: Hash-based random generation ensures reproducible results
3. **Columnar Processing**: DuckDB's columnar storage optimizes demographic segmentation queries
4. **Batch Processing**: Single SQL statement processes entire eligible population

### Integration with orchestrator_mvp Multi-Year Simulation Framework

```python
# orchestrator_mvp/run_multi_year.py integration pattern
def process_enrollment_simulation(context: AssetExecutionContext,
                                duckdb: DuckDBResource,
                                year_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Process enrollment simulation for the current year using SQL/dbt approach.

    Step 4 of orchestrator_mvp multi-year simulation: Generate enrollment events for eligible employees.
    """

    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        # Run enrollment determination model
        conn.execute("CALL dbt_run_model('int_enrollment_determination')")

        # Generate enrollment events
        enrollment_events = conn.execute("""
            SELECT * FROM generate_enrollment_events(?)
        """, [year_state['simulation_year']]).df()

        # Update year state with enrollment metrics
        year_state['enrollment_metrics'] = {
            'total_eligible': len(enrollment_events),
            'enrolled_count': len(enrollment_events[enrollment_events['enrolled']]),
            'opt_out_count': len(enrollment_events[enrollment_events['will_opt_out']]),
            'avg_deferral_rate': enrollment_events['deferral_rate'].mean()
        }

    return enrollment_events
```
