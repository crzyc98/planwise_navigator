# Epic E047: Production Testing & Validation Framework

**Epic Points**: 14
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Duration**: 1 Sprint
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Last Updated**: August 19, 2025

## Epic Story

**As a** platform engineering team
**I want** comprehensive automated testing and validation for production readiness
**So that** we can deploy PlanWise Navigator with confidence and catch regressions before they impact production

## Business Context

PlanWise Navigator currently relies on **manual testing and ad-hoc validation**, making it difficult to ensure production readiness and prevent regressions. With complex multi-year simulations processing 42,331 events across 9,016 employees, automated validation is essential for maintaining data quality and operational reliability.

This epic establishes a comprehensive testing framework that validates business logic, data quality, performance characteristics, and operational resilience. The framework builds on the previous epics to provide end-to-end production validation.

## Current Testing Gaps

- **No automated production validation**: Manual verification of simulation results
- **No smoke testing**: No quick validation that basic functionality works
- **No deterministic testing**: Cannot ensure reproducible results
- **No performance benchmarking**: No automated performance regression detection
- **No data quality automation**: Manual validation of data integrity

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

### Automated Test Coverage
- [x] **Smoke tests** validating basic simulation functionality in <60 seconds
- [x] **Data quality tests** automatically detecting integrity violations
- [x] **Performance benchmarks** ensuring simulation speed within acceptable bounds
- [x] **Deterministic tests** validating reproducible results with fixed seeds

### Business Logic Validation
- [x] **Business metrics tests** ensuring results make sense (growth, compensation, contributions)
- [x] **Regulatory compliance tests** validating IRS limits and plan rules
- [x] **Cross-year consistency tests** ensuring proper state transitions
- [x] **Edge case handling** testing boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Production Readiness
- [x] **End-to-end validation** testing complete multi-year workflows
- [x] **Recovery testing** validating backup and checkpoint systems
- [x] **Load testing** ensuring performance under realistic data volumes
- [x] **Environment validation** testing production configuration requirements
