# Epic E024: Contribution Calculator

## Epic Overview

### Summary
Develop a high-performance contribution calculation engine using SQL/dbt that computes employee deferrals while enforcing core IRS limits for 100K+ employees. This MVP focuses on essential contribution logic while deferring complex scenarios to post-MVP phases.

### Business Value
- Ensures 100% compliance with core IRS contribution limits avoiding penalties
- Accurately projects contribution amounts for plan cost modeling
- Provides foundation for advanced contribution features and optimization

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Calculates contributions with 100% accuracy using SQL/dbt processing
- âœ… Enforces core IRS limits (402(g), catch-up) using DuckDB optimization
- âœ… Processes 100K employees in <10 seconds using columnar processing
- âœ… Generates contribution events integrated with existing event sourcing
- âœ… Achieves reproducible results with deterministic calculations
- âœ… Provides audit trail for regulatory compliance

### MVP Implementation Approach
This epic follows the proven E022/E023 pattern:

**MVP Phase (2 weeks - 18 points)**
- SQL/dbt-first implementation for maximum performance
- Core IRS limit enforcement (402(g) and catch-up)
- Basic compensation processing with simple inclusion rules
- Integration with orchestrator_mvp/run_multi_year.py simulation framework

## Technical Specifications

```

#### Core SQL Models

**int_contribution_calculation.sql** - Main contribution processing logic:
```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

WITH eligible_employees AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref('int_eligibility_determination') }}
    WHERE is_eligible = true
),

enrolled_employees AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref('int_enrollment_determination') }}
    WHERE enrolled = true
),

compensation_base AS (
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.simulation_year,
        e.annual_compensation,
        e.current_age,
        -- Apply IRS compensation limit
        LEAST(e.annual_compensation, {{ var('irs_compensation_limit_2025', 360000) }}) AS eligible_compensation,

        -- Determine catch-up eligibility
        CASE
            WHEN e.current_age >= 50 AND {{ var('enable_catch_up_contributions', true) }}
                THEN {{ var('catch_up_limit_2025', 7500) }}
            ELSE 0
        END AS catch_up_eligibility,

        -- Get deferral elections from enrollment
        en.deferral_rate,
        COALESCE(en.deferral_type, 'percentage') as deferral_type,
        COALESCE(en.deferral_amount, 0.0) as deferral_amount

    FROM eligible_employees e
    INNER JOIN enrolled_employees en USING (employee_id, simulation_year)
),

deferral_calculations AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Calculate requested deferral based on election type
        CASE
            WHEN deferral_type = 'percentage'
                THEN eligible_compensation * deferral_rate
            WHEN deferral_type = 'dollar'
                THEN LEAST(deferral_amount, eligible_compensation)
            ELSE 0
        END AS requested_deferral,

        -- Calculate applicable 402(g) limit
        {{ var('elective_deferral_limit_2025', 23500) }} + catch_up_eligibility AS applicable_402g_limit

    FROM compensation_base
),

limit_enforcement AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Apply 402(g) limit enforcement
        LEAST(requested_deferral, applicable_402g_limit) AS final_employee_deferral,

        -- Track limit applications
        CASE
            WHEN requested_deferral > applicable_402g_limit
                THEN 'limit_applied'
            ELSE 'no_limit'
        END as limit_status,

        -- Calculate reduction amount if limited
        GREATEST(0, requested_deferral - applicable_402g_limit) as limit_reduction_amount

    FROM deferral_calculations
),

ytd_tracking AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Simple YTD accumulation (MVP approach)
        final_employee_deferral as current_period_deferral,
        final_employee_deferral as ytd_deferrals,  -- Simplified for MVP

        -- Deterministic random seed for reproducibility
        (ABS(HASH(employee_id || simulation_year || 'contribution')) % 1000000) / 1000000.0 as contribution_random_seed

    FROM limit_enforcement
)

SELECT
    employee_id,
    simulation_year,
    eligible_compensation,
    deferral_rate,
    deferral_type,
    requested_deferral,
    applicable_402g_limit,
    final_employee_deferral,
    limit_status,
    limit_reduction_amount,
    catch_up_eligibility,
    current_period_deferral,
    ytd_deferrals,
    contribution_random_seed
FROM ytd_tracking
```

### Event Generation Integration

Unlike E022 (eligibility as filters) and similar to E023 (enrollment events), E024 generates actual contribution events:

```sql
-- Generate CONTRIBUTION events for calculated amounts
INSERT INTO fct_yearly_events
SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as event_id,
    employee_id,
    'contribution' as event_type,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) as effective_date,
    simulation_year,
    '{{ var("scenario_id", "default") }}' as scenario_id,
    '{{ var("plan_design_id", "standard") }}' as plan_design_id,
    json_object(
        'event_type', 'contribution',
        'plan_id', 'plan_001',  -- TODO: Link to actual plan
        'source', 'employee_pre_tax',
        'amount', final_employee_deferral,
        'pay_period_end', DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 month' - INTERVAL '1 day',
        'contribution_date', DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 month',
        'ytd_amount', ytd_deferrals,
        'payroll_id', employee_id || '_' || simulation_year || '_monthly',
        'irs_limit_applied', limit_status = 'limit_applied',
        'inferred_value', false
    ) as payload,
    current_timestamp as created_at
FROM {{ ref('int_contribution_calculation') }}
WHERE final_employee_deferral > 0;
```

### Performance Optimizations

Following the E022/E023 pattern:

1. **Vectorized Operations**: SQL CASE statements for maximum DuckDB optimization
2. **Deterministic Randomness**: Hash-based seed generation for reproducible results
3. **Columnar Processing**: DuckDB's columnar storage optimizes limit calculations
4. **Batch Processing**: Single SQL statement processes entire eligible population
5. **Simple YTD Tracking**: Simplified accumulation logic for MVP speed

### Integration with orchestrator_mvp/run_multi_year.py

```python
# orchestrator_mvp multi-year simulation framework integration pattern
def process_contribution_calculations(context: Dict[str, Any],
                                    duckdb_connection,
                                    year_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Process contribution calculations for the current year using SQL/dbt approach.

    Step 6 of orchestrator_mvp/run_multi_year.py: Calculate employee contributions with IRS limits.
    """

    # Run contribution calculation model via orchestrator_mvp
    duckdb_connection.execute("CALL dbt_run_model('int_contribution_calculation')")

    # Generate contribution events
    contribution_events = duckdb_connection.execute("""
        SELECT * FROM generate_contribution_events(?)
    """, [year_state['simulation_year']]).df()

        # Update year state with contribution metrics
        year_state['contribution_metrics'] = {
            'total_participants': len(contribution_events),
            'total_deferrals': contribution_events['final_employee_deferral'].sum(),
            'avg_deferral_rate': contribution_events['deferral_rate'].mean(),
            'limits_applied_count': len(contribution_events[contribution_events['limit_status'] == 'limit_applied']),
            'avg_deferral_amount': contribution_events['final_employee_deferral'].mean()
        }

    return contribution_events
```
