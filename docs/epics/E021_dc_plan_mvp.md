    # 2. Generate enrollment events
    enrollment_count = generate_enrollment_events(simulation_year, conn)

    # 3. Generate contribution events
    contribution_count = generate_contribution_events(simulation_year, conn)

    return eligibility_count + enrollment_count + contribution_count
```

### Story S072-04: Basic dbt Models for DC Plan Data (8 points)
**As a** data engineer

        ELSE 'COMPLIANT'
    END as compliance_status
FROM age_calculation
```

## Technical Implementation

### Event Generation Integration
DC plan events will be generated as part of the existing multi-year simulation workflow:

```python
# In multi_year_simulation.py
def run_single_year_simulation(year: int, config: dict) -> dict:
    """Extended to include DC plan events"""

    # Existing workforce events (steps 1-5)
    termination_events = generate_termination_events(year, config)
    hire_events = generate_hire_events(year, config)
    new_hire_termination_events = generate_new_hire_termination_events(year, config)
    merit_events = generate_merit_events(year, config)
    promotion_events = generate_promotion_events(year, config)

    # NEW: DC plan events (step 6)
    dc_plan_events = generate_dc_plan_events(year, config)

    # Generate workforce snapshot
    snapshot_result = generate_workforce_snapshot(year, config)

    return {
        'workforce_events': termination_events + hire_events + new_hire_termination_events + merit_events + promotion_events,
        'dc_plan_events': dc_plan_events,
        'snapshot': snapshot_result
    }
```

### Configuration Extensions
Add DC plan parameters to existing `config/simulation_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Existing workforce parameters
workforce:
  total_termination_rate: 0.12
  new_hire_termination_rate: 0.25

# NEW: DC plan parameters
dc_plan:
  eligibility_requirements:
    minimum_age: 21
    minimum_service_months: 12
    hours_requirement: 1000

  contribution_rates:
    default_pre_tax_rate: 0.06
    default_roth_rate: 0.00
    max_deferral_rate: 0.50

  matching:
    formula: "100% on first 3%"
    max_match_percentage: 0.03

  compliance:
    hce_threshold: 160000  # 2025 limit
    employee_deferral_limit: 23500  # 2025 limit
    catch_up_limit: 7500  # 2025 limit
```

### Database Schema Extensions
Extend existing tables to support DC plan events:

```sql
-- Extend fct_yearly_events to include DC plan event types
-- This uses the existing table structure, just adds new event_type values:
-- 'eligibility', 'enrollment', 'contribution', 'vesting'

-- New models will reference existing tables:
-- int_baseline_workforce -> provides employee demographics
-- fct_workforce_snapshot -> provides compensation data
-- fct_yearly_events -> stores all events including DC plan events
```

## Performance Requirements (MVP)

| Metric | MVP Requirement | Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Employee Capacity | 10,000 employees | Use existing orchestrator_mvp patterns |
| Event Processing | <5 minutes per simulation year | Extend existing event generation |
| Multi-Year Simulation | 2025-2029 in <30 minutes | Use existing multi-year framework |
| Memory Usage | <4GB total | Follow existing memory-efficient patterns |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Event payload validation using existing patterns
- HCE determination logic
- Basic compliance validation
- Integration with existing event_emitter tests

### Integration Tests
- Full multi-year simulation with DC plan events
- dbt model data quality tests
- Integration with existing workforce events

### Example Test:
```python
def test_dc_plan_event_generation():
    """Test DC plan events are generated correctly"""
    config = load_test_config()

    # Generate DC plan events for 2025
    event_count = generate_dc_plan_events(2025, config)

    # Verify events were created
    assert event_count > 0

    # Verify event types
    conn = get_connection()
    result = conn.execute("""
        SELECT DISTINCT event_type
        FROM fct_yearly_events
        WHERE simulation_year = 2025
        AND event_type IN ('eligibility', 'enrollment', 'contribution')
    """).fetchall()

    assert len(result) >= 3  # At least 3 event types generated
```
