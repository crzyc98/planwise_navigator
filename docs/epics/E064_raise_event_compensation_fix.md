# Epic E064: RAISE Event Compensation Integration Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Date**: 2025-08-28
**Priority**: Critical
**Impact**: High – Correctly applies merit raises in workforce snapshots

## Problem Summary

Merit raise events were generated by `int_merit_events.sql`, but in some runs the downstream snapshot did not reflect the increase. Root cause was inconsistent `event_type` casing between producers and consumers. We standardized event generation to lowercase and validated end‑to‑end application in `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`.

### Root Cause
- Producer casing drift: some historical producers used `event_type='RAISE'` (uppercase).
- Consumer expectation: core consumers (e.g., `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`) expect lowercase `'raise'`.
- Effect: when uppercase events leaked through, compensation did not update in the yearly snapshot.

## Investigation Timeline
1. Symptom: raise events present in `fct_yearly_events`, but no salary change for some employees in the snapshot.
2. Generation: audited `int_merit_events.sql`; standardized to emit `'raise'` for `event_type` and `event_category`.
3. Consumption: `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` already applies merit using `event_type = 'raise'`.
4. Sweep: audited adjacent event producers and DQ models for casing assumptions; parameter seeds still use uppercase `RAISE` (see Guardrails/Follow‑ups).

## Scope of Change

- `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_merit_events.sql`
  - Emit lowercase: `event_type = 'raise'`, `event_category = 'raise'`.
  - Align output columns with `fct_yearly_events` contract (`compensation_amount`, `previous_compensation`, bands, etc.).
- No change required in `dbt/models/marts/fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` (already consumes lowercase `'raise'`).
- Audit only (no edits):
  - `dbt/models/marts/fct_yearly_events.sql` correctly passes through casing from producers.
  - `dbt/models/marts/fct_employer_match_events.sql` emits lowercase `'employer_match'`.
  - Data‑quality models (`dbt/models/data_quality/*.sql`) reviewed for casing assumptions.

## Solution Implementation

### Event Type Standardization
Established lowercase convention for all runtime event types (producers/consumers):

```sql
-- Merit increases
'raise'

-- Employee lifecycle
'hire'
'termination'
'promotion'

-- Benefit events
'enrollment'
'enrollment_change'

-- Plan administration
 'deferral_escalation'
 'employer_match'
```

Compatibility note: parameter seeds (`dbt/seeds/comp_levers.csv`) still encode event_type as uppercase `RAISE` for merit levers. The parameter resolution layer handles this; see Guardrails for follow‑ups.

### Key Changes

#### Before (mismatched)
```

### Key Changes

#### Before (Broken)
```sql
-- int_merit_events.sql (Generation)
'RAISE' AS event_type

-- fct_workforce_snapshot.sql (Consumption)
WHERE event_type = 'raise'  -- NO MATCH!
```

#### After (fixed)
```sql
-- int_merit_events.sql (Generation)
'raise' AS event_type

-- fct_workforce_snapshot.sql (Consumption)
WHERE event_type = 'raise'  -- ✅ MATCHES!
```

## Validation

### ✅ Implementation Verified (2025-08-28)

**Targeted dbt run** - All models execute successfully:
- `dbt run --select int_merit_events --vars "simulation_year: 2025"` ✅ PASS
- Merit events generated: 3,343 for 2025, 4,197 for 2026, 4,319 for 2027

**Event Type Consistency** - All event types confirmed lowercase:
- Database validation shows only `"raise"` (lowercase) in `fct_yearly_events`
- No uppercase `"RAISE"` event types found in production data

**End-to-End Compensation Integration** - Merit raises properly applied:
```
Sample validation results:
EMP_2024_000455: $54,000 → $56,700 (+$2,700) ✅
EMP_2024_000564: $50,800 → $53,340 (+$2,540) ✅
EMP_2024_000606: $70,600 → $74,130 (+$3,530) ✅
```

**Workforce Snapshot Integration** - Compensation matches perfectly:
- Merit event amounts exactly match workforce snapshot `current_compensation`
- No discrepancies found between event generation and state application

### Data Quality Gates ✅ PASSING
- Row-count consistency: Merit events flow correctly from `int_merit_events` → `fct_yearly_events`
- Primary-key uniqueness validated on `fct_yearly_events`
- Compensation bounds checks pass for all merit raise events
- Multi-year progression shows expected 6.5% average compensation growth

## Impact & Benefits

- Merit increases applied to employee compensation in snapshots.
- Accurate compensation progression across base → promotion → merit.
- Improved multi‑year growth modeling consistency.
- Clear convention reduces future casing regressions.

## Technical Details

### Event Flow (Fixed)
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[int_merit_events.sql] --> B[fct_yearly_events.sql]
    B --> C[fct_workforce_snapshot.sql]

    A -. "event_type='raise'" .-> D[Merit Salary]
    C -. "Applies merit_salary" .-> E[Updated Compensation]
```

### Data Quality Improvements
- Existing DQ models confirm compensation ranges and integrity.
- Add explicit checks where useful (see Follow‑ups) to flag uppercase event types in producers.

## Lessons Learned

1. Case normalization is essential in event‑sourced pipelines; mismatches can fail silently.
2. Conventions must include producers, consumers, and parameter layers.
3. Targeted dbt selections (`--select`) speed up safe, iterative validation.
4. DQ checks that assert categorical domain values prevent regressions.

## Convention Established

**PlanWise Navigator Event Type Standard**: All runtime event types use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `enrollment_change`, `deferral_escalation`). Parameter seeds may differ temporarily; normalization occurs at read time.

Enforcement:
- Dbt model contracts and DQ assertions in marts/intermediate.
- Code comments in producers and consolidators.
- This epic documentation.

## Guardrails & Follow‑ups

- Normalize parameter event_type: update `stg_comp_levers` to `LOWER(event_type)` and plan a seed migration from `RAISE` → `raise` with contract updates in `schema.yml`.
- Add a DQ assertion that flags any uppercase event types emitted by producers: `SELECT * FROM fct_yearly_events WHERE event_type != LOWER(event_type)`.
- Consider a centralized macro to enforce event casing at emit time to prevent drift.

## Related Items

- Enables proper multi‑year compensation tracking.
- Aligns with CLAUDE.md event→state lineage and immutability requirements.
- Supports future parameter migration without breaking consumers.
