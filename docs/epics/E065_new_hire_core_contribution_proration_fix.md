# Epic E065: Fix New Hire Core Contribution Proration Bug

**Epic ID**: E065
**Status**: üîß In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Epic Type**: Critical Bug Fix
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Estimated Effort**: 5 story points
**GitHub Issue**: [#45](https://github.com/crzyc98/planwise_navigator/issues/45)

## Problem Statement

New hires are receiving employer core contributions calculated on their full annual compensation instead of prorated compensation based on actual hours worked. This represents a critical violation of the 1000-hour minimum requirement and results in approximately 2x the intended core contribution amounts.

### Current Impact
- **Financial Impact**: ~$400,000+ annually in excess employer contributions
- **Affected Employees**: 392 new hires in 2025 (44.9% of all new hires)
- **Configuration Violation**: Defeats the purpose of the 1000-hour minimum requirement
- **Multi-Year Issue**: Problem persists across all simulation years

### Evidence from Data Analysis
```sql
-- Example: July hire NH_2025_000554
-- Full compensation: $86,832.90
-- Prorated compensation: $41,870.11 (for ~5 months employment)
-- Core contribution received: $868.33 (1% of FULL compensation)
-- Core contribution should be: $418.70 (1% of PRORATED compensation)
-- Over-contribution: $449.63 (107% excess)
```

### Behavioral Impact Analysis

| Hire Month | Hours Worked | Should Qualify | Current Behavior | Expected Behavior |
|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| January | ~1990 | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Gets core (correct) | ‚úÖ Gets core |
| July | ~1000 | ‚úÖ Barely | ‚ùå Gets 2x core | ‚úÖ Gets 1x core |
| August | ~800 | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå Gets 2x core | ‚ùå Gets $0 |
| December | ~95 | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå Gets 21x core | ‚ùå Gets $0 |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Root Cause
**Location**: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_employer_core_contributions.sql`, lines 133-157

The `workforce_proration` CTE has a critical logic error:

1. **Line 139**: All employees (including new hires) get `employee_compensation AS prorated_annual_compensation` (no proration applied)
2. **Lines 155-156**: The `WHERE employee_id NOT IN` clause excludes properly prorated new hire entries from `new_hire_proration`
3. **Result**: New hires use their full annual compensation instead of prorated compensation for core contribution calculations

### Code Analysis
```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC CODE (lines 133-157)
workforce_proration AS (
    -- Snapshot population for existing employees
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        simulation_year,
        employee_compensation AS current_compensation,
        employee_compensation AS prorated_annual_compensation, -- ‚ùå NO PRORATION!
        employment_status,
        NULL::DATE AS termination_date
    FROM employee_compensation

    UNION ALL

    -- Current-year new hires with independent proration
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        simulation_year,
        current_compensation,
        prorated_annual_compensation, -- ‚úÖ PROPERLY PRORATED
        employment_status,
        termination_date
    FROM new_hire_proration
    WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
        SELECT employee_id FROM employee_compensation -- ‚ùå EXCLUDES ALL NEW HIRES!
    )
)
```

### Data Flow Issue
1. New hires appear in `int_employee_compensation_by_year` (875 employees in 2025)
2. They get included in `employee_compensation` CTE with full compensation
3. The `workforce_proration` CTE uses full compensation (line 139) instead of prorated
4. The properly prorated `new_hire_proration` entries are excluded (lines 155-156)
5. Core contribution calculation uses full compensation via COALESCE fallback

## Configuration Context

From `config/simulation_config.yaml`:
```yaml
employer_core_contribution:
  enabled: true
  contribution_rate: 0.01  # 1% core contribution rate
  eligibility:
    minimum_tenure_years: 0
    require_active_at_year_end: true
    minimum_hours_annual: 1000     # 1000-hour requirement
    allow_new_hires: true
    allow_terminated_new_hires: false
```

The intent is clear: new hires should only receive core contributions if they work ‚â•1000 hours, and the contribution should be 1% of their **prorated** compensation.

## Proposed Solution

### Fix Strategy: Properly Handle New Hire Proration

**Objective**: Ensure new hires use prorated compensation for core contribution calculations while maintaining existing employee logic.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Modify `workforce_proration` CTE** to distinguish between existing employees and new hires
2. **Use prorated compensation** for new hires from `new_hire_proration`
3. **Maintain existing logic** for continuous employees
4. **Add data quality validation** to prevent regression

### Detailed Fix

```sql
-- PROPOSED FIX
workforce_proration AS (
    -- Existing employees (NOT hired this year) - use full compensation
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        simulation_year,
        employee_compensation AS current_compensation,
        employee_compensation AS prorated_annual_compensation,
        employment_status,
        NULL::DATE AS termination_date
    FROM employee_compensation
    WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
        -- Exclude current-year new hires to avoid duplication
        SELECT employee_id FROM hire_events
    )

    UNION ALL

    -- Current-year new hires - use properly prorated compensation
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        simulation_year,
        current_compensation,
        prorated_annual_compensation,  -- ‚úÖ PROPERLY PRORATED
        employment_status,
        termination_date
    FROM new_hire_proration
)
```

2. **Hour Enforcement**: Employees with <1000 hours get $0 core
3. **Financial Alignment**: July hires receive ~50% of current core amounts
4. **No Regression**: Existing employees maintain current behavior

### Validation Queries
```sql
-- Verify proper proration for new hires
SELECT
    employee_id,
    employee_hire_date,
    prorated_annual_compensation,
    employer_core_amount,
    ROUND(employer_core_amount / prorated_annual_compensation, 4) as core_rate
FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
WHERE simulation_year = 2025
  AND employee_hire_date >= '2025-01-01'
  AND employer_core_amount > 0
  AND ABS(employer_core_amount / prorated_annual_compensation - 0.01) > 0.001;
-- Should return 0 rows after fix

-- Verify <1000 hour employees get $0 core
SELECT COUNT(*) as violations
FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
WHERE simulation_year = 2025
  AND annual_hours_worked < 1000
  AND employer_core_amount > 0;
-- Should return 0 after fix
```
