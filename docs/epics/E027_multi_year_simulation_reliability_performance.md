## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Cold Start Workforce Failure**: Multi-year simulations start with empty workforce on fresh runs, causing subsequent years to have no active employees
2. **SCD Performance Bottleneck**: `scd_workforce_state` takes 19+ minutes on powerful hardware (16 vCPU/64GB), blocking simulation completion
3. **Missing Bootstrap Logic**: No proper initialization sequence for "year 0" scenarios in workforce baseline preparation
4. **Inefficient SCD Implementation**: Slowly changing dimension logic lacks optimization for incremental processing

### Root Causes
- `int_previous_year_workforce` model expects prior year data that doesn't exist on cold starts
- SCD implementation uses inefficient queries causing full table rebuilds
- Missing conditional logic to handle fresh vs continuing simulations
- Lack of proper workforce state handoff between simulation years

## Technical Specifications

### Cold Start Bootstrap Pattern
```python
def initialize_workforce_baseline(duckdb_conn, simulation_year: int):
    """Initialize workforce baseline with proper cold start handling"""

    # Check if this is a cold start (no prior year data)
    prior_year_exists = duckdb_conn.execute(f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as count
        FROM information_schema.tables
        WHERE table_name = 'int_previous_year_workforce'
    """).fetchone()[0] > 0

    if not prior_year_exists or simulation_year == 1:
        # Cold start: Initialize from census data
        duckdb_conn.execute("""
            CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE int_previous_year_workforce AS
            SELECT
                employee_id,
                hire_date,
                termination_date,
                annual_salary,
                'ACTIVE' as employee_status,
                0 as simulation_year
            FROM stg_census_data
            WHERE termination_date IS NULL
        """)
    else:
        # Continuing simulation: Use previous year's end state
        duckdb_conn.execute(f"""
            CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE int_previous_year_workforce AS
            SELECT *
            FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
            WHERE simulation_year = {simulation_year - 1}
        """)
```

### SCD Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Optimized SCD implementation with incremental processing
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE scd_workforce_state AS
WITH changed_employees AS (
    -- Only process employees with changes
    SELECT DISTINCT employee_id
    FROM fct_yearly_events
    WHERE simulation_year = ?
),
workforce_changes AS (
    SELECT
        w.employee_id,
        w.simulation_year,
        w.annual_salary,
        w.employee_status,
        w.effective_date,
        LAG(w.annual_salary) OVER (
            PARTITION BY w.employee_id
            ORDER BY w.simulation_year
        ) as prev_salary,
        CASE
            WHEN w.annual_salary != LAG(w.annual_salary) OVER (
                PARTITION BY w.employee_id
                ORDER BY w.simulation_year
            ) THEN 'CHANGED'
            ELSE 'UNCHANGED'
        END as scd_flag
    FROM fct_workforce_snapshot w
    INNER JOIN changed_employees c ON w.employee_id = c.employee_id
)
SELECT *
FROM workforce_changes
WHERE scd_flag = 'CHANGED'

-- Union with unchanged employees from previous processing
UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM scd_workforce_state_previous
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM changed_employees);
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
```python
from orchestrator.performance_monitor import PerformanceMonitor

def monitor_scd_performance(asset_context, start_time, end_time, row_count):
    """Monitor SCD performance with SLA alerting"""

    execution_time = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()

    # SLA: SCD processing should complete in <2 minutes
    sla_threshold = 120  # seconds

    if execution_time > sla_threshold:
        asset_context.log.warning(
            f"SCD processing exceeded SLA: {execution_time:.2f}s > {sla_threshold}s"
        )

        # Send alert through performance monitoring
        PerformanceMonitor.record_sla_breach(
            asset_name="scd_workforce_state",
            execution_time=execution_time,
            sla_threshold=sla_threshold,
            row_count=row_count
        )

    # Record performance metrics
    PerformanceMonitor.record_execution_time(
        asset_name="scd_workforce_state",
        execution_time=execution_time,
        row_count=row_count
    )
```
