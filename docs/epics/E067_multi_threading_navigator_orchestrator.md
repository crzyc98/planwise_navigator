## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Performance Bottleneck**: Navigator Orchestrator runs all 250+ model executions sequentially
2. **Underutilized Hardware**: Modern workstations with 4-16 cores running single-threaded
3. **Long Simulation Times**: 10-minute runtime for 5-year simulations limits analyst productivity
4. **Scalability Limitations**: No ability to leverage additional compute resources
5. **Competitive Disadvantage**: Other simulation platforms offer parallelization capabilities

### Root Causes
- Current implementation forces sequential execution even for independent operations
- No thread configuration framework in Navigator Orchestrator
- Missing model dependency analysis for safe parallelization
- Lack of thread-safe execution patterns in the orchestration layer
- No performance benchmarking infrastructure for multi-threaded scenarios

### Business Impact
- **Development Efficiency**: Slower iteration cycles for workforce analysts
- **Resource Waste**: Inefficient use of available compute capacity
- **Time-to-Insight**: Delayed business decisions due to simulation bottlenecks
- **Competitive Position**: Lagging behind industry standards for simulation performance

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: dbt Threading Foundation
```yaml
# config/simulation_config.yaml
orchestrator:
  threading:
    enabled: true
    thread_count: 4  # 1-16, auto-detect available cores
    mode: "selective"  # selective, aggressive, sequential
    memory_per_thread_gb: 1.0
```

### Phase 2: Model Classification System
```python
class ModelExecutionType(Enum):
    SEQUENTIAL = "sequential"      # State accumulators, event generation
    PARALLEL_SAFE = "parallel"    # Hazard calculations, independent metrics
    CONDITIONAL = "conditional"   # Depends on upstream completion
```

### Phase 3: Thread-Safe Execution Engine
```python
class ThreadSafeOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, config: SimulationConfig):
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=config.thread_count)
        self.dependency_graph = ModelDependencyGraph()
        self.execution_monitor = ExecutionMonitor()
```
