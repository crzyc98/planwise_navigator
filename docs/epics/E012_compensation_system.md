# Epic E012: Compensation System Integrity Fix

**Epic Owner**: System Architecture Team
**Sprint**: TBD (Next Available)
**Priority**: Must Have (Critical System Integrity)
**Estimated Effort**: 18 story points

## Problem Statement

Critical compensation calculation errors in the workforce simulation are causing unrealistic salary assignments and distorted analytics. The root cause is extreme `max_compensation` values in `config_job_levels.csv` (Level 4: $10M, Level 5: $15M) that create massive average compensation calculations, resulting in new hires with million-dollar salaries.

### Impact Analysis

- **Current State**: New hire average compensation shows $18K (artificially low due to proration of inflated base salaries)
- **Actual Issue**: Level 4/5 new hires assigned $5M+ base salaries that get prorated down
- **Business Impact**: All compensation analytics are distorted, making financial projections unreliable
- **Technical Debt**: Compensation logic propagates errors across multiple models

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Source Data Quality
- `config_job_levels.csv` contains unrealistic max_compensation values
- Level 4: $10,000,000 (should be ~$300,000)
- Level 5: $15,000,000 (should be ~$500,000)

### Secondary Issue: Calculation Logic
- `int_hiring_events.sql` lines 120-126: avg_compensation calculation uses uncapped values
- Even though caps exist (lines 114-117), the average formula bypasses them
- Formula: `(min_compensation + max_compensation) / 2` results in $5M+ averages

### Propagation Path
```
config_job_levels.csv (bad data)
  ↓
stg_config_job_levels.sql (passes through uncapped)
  ↓
int_hiring_events.sql compensation_ranges CTE (avg_compensation inflated)
  ↓
new_hire_assignments (million-dollar salaries assigned)
  ↓
fct_workforce_snapshot.sql (prorated compensation distorted)
```

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Quality Fix
1. **Source Data Correction**: Update `config_job_levels.csv` with realistic compensation ranges
2. **Validation**: Ensure compensation progression remains logical across all levels

### Phase 2: Calculation Logic Enhancement
1. **Average Calculation Fix**: Update `int_hiring_events.sql` to use capped values in average
2. **Consistency Check**: Align all compensation logic with intended business rules

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Prevention
1. **Asset Checks**: Implement validation to prevent future compensation anomalies
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive validation across multi-year simulations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify
- `dbt/seeds/config_job_levels.csv`: Fix max_compensation values
- `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_hiring_events.sql`: Fix avg_compensation calculation

## Phase 2: Compensation Growth Calibration Framework

### Problem Statement (Discovered in Phase 1)

While compensation calculation integrity has been restored, **new analysis reveals compensation dilution** causing negative average growth (-0.02%) despite COLA and merit increases. This prevents achieving the business target of 2% annual average compensation growth.

### Root Cause: Compensation Dilution Effect

**Primary Issue**: New hire compensation dilution outpaces existing employee raises
- **New hires**: Enter at lower salary levels ($112K average full salary, $38K prorated)
- **Existing employees**: Receive 6.5% combined COLA (2.5%) + Merit (4%) increases
- **Net effect**: High volume of lower-paid new hires dilutes overall average despite individual raises

### Key Findings from Current Analysis

```
Employee Segment          | Count | Avg Current Comp | Avg Prorated | Impact
--------------------------|-------|------------------|--------------|--------
continuous_active         |   87  |     $198,592     |   $198,592   | ↗️ Positive
new_hire_active           |   29  |     $112,308     |    $38,087   | ↘️ Dilutive
experienced_termination   |    -  |         -        |       -      | ↗️ Removes lower performers
new_hire_termination      |    -  |         -        |       -      | ↘️ Removes recent investments

Current Overall Growth: -0.02% (Target: +2.0%)
```

### Compensation Policy Calibration Strategy

#### Primary Tuning Levers (Direct Impact)
1. **COLA Rate** (`simulation_config.yaml`): Currently 2.5% → Adjust to 3.0-4.0%
2. **Merit Budget** (`simulation_config.yaml`): Currently 4.0% → Adjust to 5.0-6.0%
3. **New Hire Baseline** (`config_job_levels.csv`): Increase min_compensation for levels 1-2
4. **Promotion Increase** (`simulation_config.yaml`): Currently 15% → Optimize for broader impact

#### Secondary Tuning Levers (Compositional Impact)
1. **Termination Rates**: Adjust to retain higher-compensated employees
2. **New Hire Volume**: Balance growth targets with compensation dilution
3. **Level Distribution**: Shift new hire distribution toward higher levels

### Implementation Approach

## Phase 3: Realistic Raise Timing Implementation

### Problem Statement (Identified During Compensation Analysis)

**Current Issue**: All employee raises occur on January 1st in the simulation, creating unrealistic compensation patterns and making prorated annual compensation calculations meaningless.

### Business Impact
- **Unrealistic Patterns**: No real company gives 100% of raises on January 1st
- **Prorated Calculations**: Mid-year compensation adjustments are not properly reflected
- **Analytics Distortion**: Compensation growth patterns don't match real-world business cycles
- **Audit Concerns**: Unrealistic timing makes simulation results less credible for planning

### Technical Solution Overview

**Realistic Raise Distribution Pattern**:
- **Annual Performance Reviews**: March-April (40% of raises)
- **Mid-year Adjustments**: July-August (30% of raises)
- **Promotion Cycles**: May/September (20% of raises)
- **Ad-hoc Raises**: Distributed throughout year (10% of raises)

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 3 Stories
- **S055**: Audit current raise timing implementation (2 points) - 1 day
- **S056**: Design realistic raise timing system (5 points) - 2 days
- **S057**: Implement raise date generation logic (8 points) - 3 days
- **S058**: Update existing raise data with new timing (5 points) - 2 days
- **S059**: Validate prorated compensation calculations (5 points) - 2 days

**Phase 3 Duration**: 8-10 business days

### Expected Outcomes

#### Quantitative Improvements
- **40%** of raises in Q1 (March-April performance cycle)
- **30%** of raises in Q3 (July-August mid-year cycle)
- **20%** of raises in Q2/Q4 (May/September promotion cycles)
- **10%** of raises distributed throughout year (ad-hoc)

#### Business Benefits
- **Realistic Simulation**: Matches actual corporate compensation practices
- **Accurate Prorating**: Mid-year raises properly reflected in annual calculations
- **Improved Analytics**: Compensation trends align with business cycles
- **Audit Compliance**: Defensible simulation methodology for planning

### Integration with Compensation Growth Calibration

The realistic raise timing will enhance the Phase 2 calibration framework by:
- Providing more accurate baseline for compensation growth calculations
- Enabling seasonal adjustment modeling
- Improving prorated compensation accuracy for new hires
- Supporting quarterly compensation planning scenarios

**Updated Next Steps**:
1. Complete Phase 2 stories S050-S054 for compensation growth calibration
2. Execute Phase 3 stories S055-S059 for realistic raise timing implementation
3. Integrate both phases for comprehensive compensation system integrity
