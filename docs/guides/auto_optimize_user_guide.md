## Current State Analysis

Before optimization, the interface displays:

### Baseline Metrics
- **Current Growth**: Your existing parameter set's growth rate
- **Target Growth**: Your desired growth rate
- **Gap Analysis**: Difference and direction of required adjustment

### Optimization Readiness
- ‚úÖ **Ready to Optimize**: Baseline exists and gap exceeds tolerance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Already at Target**: Current parameters meet requirements
- ‚ùå **Missing Baseline**: Need to run initial simulation first

---

## Running an Optimization

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Review Current State**
   - Ensure baseline simulation results are loaded
   - Verify gap analysis shows meaningful difference from target

2. **Configure Parameters**
   - Set realistic target growth rate
   - Choose appropriate optimization strategy
   - Select simulation mode based on time/accuracy needs

3. **Start Optimization**
   - Click **"üöÄ Start Auto-Optimization"**
   - Monitor progress in real-time (if enabled)
   - Wait for convergence or max iterations

4. **Review Results**
   - Check convergence status
   - Analyze final gap to target
   - Review parameter changes

### During Optimization

The interface shows:
- **Current Iteration**: Progress through max iterations
- **Live Growth Rate**: How each iteration affects growth
- **Parameter Adjustments**: What changes are being made
- **Convergence Status**: Whether target is achieved

### Typical Progression

```
Iteration 1: Current Growth 1.2% ‚Üí Gap: +0.8% (need to increase)
Iteration 2: Current Growth 1.8% ‚Üí Gap: +0.2% (getting closer)
Iteration 3: Current Growth 2.05% ‚Üí Gap: -0.05% (converged!)
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Budget Increase (Need Higher Growth)
**Situation**: Current growth 1.5%, need 3.0%
**Approach**: Use Balanced strategy, 12 iterations, 0.1% tolerance
**Expected Result**: Increased COLA and merit rates, higher new hire adjustments

### Scenario 2: Budget Tightening (Need Lower Growth)
**Situation**: Current growth 4.2%, need 2.5%
**Approach**: Use Conservative strategy to avoid overcorrection
**Expected Result**: Reduced merit rates, lower new hire premiums

### Scenario 3: Fine-Tuning (Small Adjustment)
**Situation**: Current growth 2.8%, need 3.0%
**Approach**: Use Conservative with tight tolerance (0.05%)
**Expected Result**: Minor COLA or merit adjustments

### Scenario 4: Rapid Prototyping (Multiple Targets)
**Situation**: Testing different growth scenarios
**Approach**: Use Aggressive with Synthetic mode for speed
**Expected Result**: Quick convergence for multiple "what-if" analyses

## Best Practices

### Target Setting
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with achievable targets (1-3% growth)
- **Consider Context**: Factor in economic conditions and company policies
- **Validate Feasibility**: Ensure targets align with business constraints

### Strategy Selection
- **Production Runs**: Always use Conservative or Balanced
- **Exploration**: Aggressive acceptable for initial investigation
- **Critical Decisions**: Use Real Simulation mode for final validation

### Iteration Management
- **Start with 8-10 iterations** for most scenarios
- **Increase to 15-20** for difficult convergence cases
- **Monitor progress**: Stop early if oscillating without improvement

### Parameter Validation
- **Review Changes**: Ensure parameter modifications make business sense
- **Cross-Check Results**: Validate against historical data and benchmarks
- **Document Decisions**: Keep records of optimization rationale

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot optimize without baseline results"**
- Solution: Run a simulation in the "Run Simulation" tab first
- Verify: Check that simulation completed successfully

**"Already at target - no optimization needed"**
- Review: Current parameters may already be optimal
- Consider: Tightening tolerance if refinement needed

**"Optimization failed - database lock error"**
- Solution: Close IDE database connections (VS Code, etc.)
- Retry: Database connections prevent simultaneous access

**"Convergence oscillation"**
- Symptoms: Growth rate bounces around target without converging
- Solutions: Reduce optimization aggressiveness, increase tolerance, or use different algorithm

**"Target seems unreachable"**
- Check: Whether target growth rate is realistic
- Consider: Parameter bounds may prevent achieving extreme targets
- Review: Business constraints and policy limitations

### Performance Issues

**Slow Optimization (Real Simulation Mode)**
- Expected: 2-5 minutes per iteration is normal
- Options: Switch to Synthetic mode for faster results
- Alternative: Run overnight for high-precision requirements

**Memory or CPU Issues**
- Close: Other applications to free resources
- Monitor: System performance during optimization
- Consider: Running on more powerful hardware for large datasets
