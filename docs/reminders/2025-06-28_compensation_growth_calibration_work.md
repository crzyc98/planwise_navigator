# S050-S054 Compensation Growth Calibration Work Reminder

**Date Created**: 2025-06-27
**Work Status**: Ready to Resume Tomorrow
**Epic**: E012 - Compensation System Integrity (Phase 2)
**Total Remaining Effort**: 29 story points

## Context Summary

After successfully completing S055-S057 (raise timing implementation + S041 debug fix), the next priority is Phase 2 compensation growth calibration. Current simulation shows **-0.02% average compensation growth** vs target **+2.0%** due to new hire dilution effects.

## Key Problem

**Compensation Dilution**: High-volume, lower-paid new hires are diluting overall average compensation despite existing employees receiving 6.5% combined COLA (2.5%) + Merit (4%) increases.

### Current Analysis (from completed work)
```
Employee Segment          | Count | Avg Current Comp | Avg Prorated | Impact
--------------------------|-------|------------------|--------------|--------
continuous_active         |   87  |     $198,592     |   $198,592   | ↗️ Positive
new_hire_active           |   29  |     $112,308     |    $38,087   | ↘️ Dilutive
```

## Immediate Next Steps (S050-S054)

### S050: Analyze Compensation Dilution Root Cause (3 points) - START HERE
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Duration**: 1 day

**Key Objectives**:
1. Calculate current year-over-year average compensation growth (baseline: -0.02%)
2. Decompose growth impact by employee segment (continuous_active vs new_hire_active)
3. Quantify dilution effect: new hire volume vs existing employee raises
4. Identify primary levers: COLA/merit rates vs new hire baseline compensation
5. Document current compensation policy effectiveness against 2% growth target

### S051: Design Compensation Growth Calibration Framework (5 points)
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Duration**: 2 days

**Key Objectives**:
1. Define primary tuning levers (cola_rate, merit_budget, promotion_increase)
2. Define secondary levers (job_levels baseline compensation, new_hire_termination_rate)
3. Design iterative calibration workflow with feedback loops
4. Create parameter sensitivity analysis methodology
5. Document target tolerances and validation criteria

### S052: Implement Compensation Policy Adjustment Tooling (8 points)
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Duration**: 3 days

**Key Objectives**:
1. Create parameter adjustment script for simulation_config.yaml
2. Implement automated simulation pipeline for calibration runs
3. Build compensation growth analysis dashboard/queries
4. Add asset checks for compensation growth targets (1.8%-2.2% tolerance)
5. Integration with existing Dagster monitoring and validation

### S053: Calibrate Compensation Parameters for 2% Target Growth (8 points)
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Duration**: 3 days

**Key Objectives**:
1. Run baseline analysis with current parameters (expected: negative growth)
2. Iteratively adjust COLA/merit rates to counteract new hire dilution
3. Fine-tune new hire baseline compensation (config_job_levels min/max values)
4. Validate 2% average growth sustained across 5-year simulation
5. Document final calibrated parameter set and rationale

### S054: Implement Advanced Compensation Monitoring (5 points)
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Duration**: 2 days

**Key Objectives**:
1. Real-time dashboard tracking average compensation growth vs 2% target
2. Segment-specific growth monitoring (continuous vs new_hire impact)
3. Early warning alerts for compensation dilution trends
4. Automated policy recommendation engine based on growth deviations
5. Integration with executive reporting and workforce planning dashboards

## Key Files to Work With

**Configuration Files**:
- `config/simulation_config.yaml` - COLA/merit rate tuning
- `dbt/seeds/config_job_levels.csv` - New hire baseline compensation

**Analysis Models**:
- `dbt/models/marts/fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` - Compensation tracking
- `dbt/models/marts/fct_yearly_events.sql` - Event-based analysis

**Pipeline Files**:
- `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py` - Simulation execution
- Dagster asset checks for validation

## Technical Context

**Working Database**: `/Users/nicholasamaral/planwise_navigator/simulation.duckdb`
**Schema**: `main`
**Current State**: Multi-year simulation with realistic raise timing COMPLETED
**Key Tables**: `fct_workforce_snapshot`, `fct_yearly_events`, `scd_workforce_state`

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

1. **Quantitative Target**: 2.0% ± 0.2% annual average compensation growth
2. **Sustainability**: Growth sustained across 5-year simulation
3. **Policy Documentation**: Final calibrated parameter set with business rationale
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking and early warning systems

## Priority and Urgency

**Priority**: Must Have (Critical System Integrity)
**Business Impact**: Enables accurate financial planning with reliable 2% compensation inflation assumptions
**Dependencies**: None - ready to start immediately with S050

## Recommended Start Approach

1. **Start with S050** to quantify the current dilution impact
2. Focus on **primary tuning levers** first (COLA/merit rates)
3. Use **iterative approach** with small adjustments and validation
4. Document all changes for **audit compliance**

**Next Action**: Begin S050 analysis to understand exact dilution mechanics and establish baseline for calibration work.
