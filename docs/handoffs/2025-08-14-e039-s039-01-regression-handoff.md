## Critical Regression Introduced ðŸš¨

### Issue: Workforce Snapshot Multi-Year Data Loss
**Problem**: Changes to `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql` broke incremental model behavior
- **Before**: Navigator orchestrator produced data for all years (2025-2029)
- **After**: Only final year (2029) data retained, historical years lost
- **Root Cause**: Added LEFT JOINs to incremental model may have affected year accumulation

### Files Modified (Causing Regression)
1. **`dbt/models/marts/fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`**
   - Added LEFT JOINs to `int_employee_match_calculations` and `int_employer_core_contributions`
   - Added 3 new employer contribution columns
   - Incremental model with `unique_key=['employee_id', 'simulation_year']` now malfunctioning

2. **`navigator_orchestrator/pipeline.py`**
   - Added employer models to FOUNDATION stage
   - Added validation logic for new models
   - May have affected multi-year execution order

## Working Implementation Details

### Models Created
```sql
-- int_employer_eligibility.sql (WORKING)
-- Simple eligibility: 2080 hours for active employees
-- 1000 hour threshold for contributions
-- Separate flags for match and core eligibility

-- int_employer_core_contributions.sql (WORKING)
-- 2% flat rate for eligible employees
-- COALESCE null handling
-- Proper compensation joins
```

### Orchestrator Integration
```python
# run_multi_year.py - Step 5.5 (WORKING)
"int_employer_eligibility"
"int_employer_core_contributions"

# navigator_orchestrator/pipeline.py - FOUNDATION stage (WORKING)
models=[
    "int_baseline_workforce",
    "int_employee_compensation_by_year",
    "int_effective_parameters",
    "int_workforce_needs",
    "int_workforce_needs_by_level",
    "int_employer_eligibility",        # Added
    "int_employer_core_contributions", # Added
]
```

### Data Results (When Working)
- **5,243 total employees** in workforce
- **4,368 employees (83.3%)** receiving core contributions
- **$2,942 average** employer contribution per employee
- **$15,425,874 total** annual employer contribution cost

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Fix Regression (BLOCKING)
1. **Investigate incremental model issue**
   - Determine why adding LEFT JOINs broke multi-year accumulation
   - Check if `unique_key=['employee_id', 'simulation_year']` still works correctly
   - Review navigator orchestrator multi-year execution logic

2. **Restore multi-year data**
   - Run full refresh or rebuild all years 2025-2029
   - Verify complete historical data restoration
   - Test navigator orchestrator end-to-end

### Priority 2: Complete S039-01
1. **Validate fixed implementation**
   - Confirm employer contributions work with multi-year data
   - Verify all years contain employer contribution columns
   - Run comprehensive integration tests

2. **Documentation update**
   - Update Epic E039 status
   - Document incremental model lessons learned
   - Create proper testing checklist for incremental model changes

## Potential Fixes

### Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
# Force rebuild all years with dependencies
cd dbt
dbt run --select +fct_workforce_snapshot --vars "simulation_year: 2025" --full-refresh
dbt run --select +fct_workforce_snapshot --vars "simulation_year: 2026"
dbt run --select +fct_workforce_snapshot --vars "simulation_year: 2027"
dbt run --select +fct_workforce_snapshot --vars "simulation_year: 2028"
dbt run --select +fct_workforce_snapshot --vars "simulation_year: 2029"
```

### Option B: Model Fix (If Quick Fix Fails)
```sql
-- Consider changing incremental strategy in fct_workforce_snapshot.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    incremental_strategy='delete+insert',  -- Explicit strategy
    unique_key=['employee_id', 'simulation_year'],
    on_schema_change='sync_all_columns'
) }}
```

### Option C: Revert and Redesign (Last Resort)
- Revert workforce snapshot changes
- Implement employer contributions as separate mart model
- Add to workforce snapshot in S039-02

## Testing Checklist (For Fix Validation)

### Multi-Year Data Verification
- [ ] All years 2025-2029 exist in `fct_workforce_snapshot`
- [ ] Employee counts consistent across years
- [ ] Employer contribution columns populated for all years
- [ ] Historical data integrity maintained

### Orchestrator Testing
- [ ] Simple orchestrator (`run_multi_year.py`) works end-to-end
- [ ] Navigator orchestrator produces complete multi-year results
- [ ] Both orchestrators include employer contribution models
- [ ] Validation logic works for all years

### Business Logic Validation
- [ ] Employer contribution calculations correct
- [ ] Core contribution rate (2%) applied consistently
- [ ] Eligibility logic (2080/1000 hours) working
- [ ] Total costs realistic and consistent

## Next Steps for Whoever Takes Over

1. **Immediate (Tonight if possible)**:
   - Fix the incremental model regression
   - Restore multi-year workforce snapshot data
   - Validate end-to-end functionality

2. **Short-term (Tomorrow)**:
   - Complete S039-01 validation and testing
   - Update Epic E039 documentation
   - Plan S039-02 (Workforce Snapshot Integration) - may be redundant now

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Add automated tests for incremental model changes
   - Document best practices for modifying incremental models
   - Consider whether Epic E039 architecture needs adjustment

## Contact/Questions

- **Implementation details**: All code is committed, models are working individually
- **Regression details**: See issue documentation for full analysis
- **Business logic**: Validated and producing realistic results
- **Next story impact**: S039-02 may be largely complete due to this implementation

**The employer contribution functionality is complete and working - we just need to fix the incremental model regression to restore multi-year simulation capability.**
