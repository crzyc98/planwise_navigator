## 2. Event Schema Compliance Analysis

### 2.1 Fiduciary Compliance (ERISA Section 404)

**Requirement**: Plan fiduciaries must act solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries.

**Implementation**:
- All events include complete audit trail with timestamps
- Source system tracking for accountability
- Immutable event log prevents post-facto modifications
- Participant consent tracking for investment elections

**Evidence**:
```python
# Every event includes fiduciary accountability
@dataclass
class SimulationEvent:
    event_id: str  # Immutable UUID
    event_timestamp: datetime  # Exact occurrence time
    source_system: str  # Accountability tracking
    processing_user: str  # Human accountability
```

### 2.2 Participant Direction (ERISA Section 404(c))

**Requirement**: Plans allowing participant investment direction must meet specific criteria.

**Implementation**:
- Investment election events track source of change
- Participant acknowledgment of investment risk
- Documentation of investment option selection process
- Audit trail of all investment changes

**Evidence**:
```python
class InvestmentElectionPayload:
    source_of_change: str  # "participant_directed" vs "default"
    acknowledgment_received: bool  # Risk acknowledgment
    investment_options_reviewed: bool  # Education provided
```

### 2.3 Recordkeeping (ERISA Section 107)

**Requirement**: Maintain records for 7 years enabling plan administration and participant inquiries.

**Implementation**:
- Immutable event store with DuckDB persistence
- 7+ year retention policy with automated enforcement
- Complete participant history reconstruction capability
- Audit log of all data access and modifications

**Evidence**:
- Event retention: 7+ years minimum
- Query capability: Complete history reconstruction in <5 seconds
- Data integrity: UUID-based immutable events
- Access logging: All data access recorded

### 2.4 Vesting Compliance (ERISA Section 203)

**Requirement**: Comply with minimum vesting standards for employer contributions.

**Implementation**:
- Vesting events track service crediting hours
- Multiple vesting schedule support (cliff, graded)
- Automatic forfeiture calculations
- Vesting percentage validation

**Evidence**:
```python
class VestingPayload:
    service_credited_hours: Decimal  # Service calculation
    vesting_schedule_type: str  # "cliff" or "graded"
    vesting_percentage: Decimal  # 0.00 to 100.00
    effective_date: date  # When vesting applies
```

## 3. Data Classification and Security

### 3.1 Classification Framework

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Protection Level |
|----------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **RESTRICTED** | Highest sensitivity | SSN, DOB | Encryption + Audit |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | High sensitivity | Compensation, Balances | Encryption |
| **INTERNAL** | Standard protection | Employee ID, Dates | Access Control |
| **PUBLIC** | No special protection | Plan Name | Standard |

### 3.2 Field-Level Security

#### Restricted Fields
```python
# Social Security Number
"ssn": {
    "classification": "RESTRICTED",
    "encryption_required": True,
    "access_roles": ["admin", "auditor"],
    "audit_on_access": True,
    "retention_years": 7,
    "erisa_reference": "ERISA Section 107 - Recordkeeping"
}
```

#### Confidential Fields
```python
# Annual Compensation
"annual_compensation": {
    "classification": "CONFIDENTIAL",
    "encryption_required": True,
    "access_roles": ["admin", "analyst", "auditor"],
    "retention_years": 7,
    "erisa_reference": "ERISA Section 204 - HCE determination"
}
```

### 3.3 Access Control Matrix

| Role | Restricted | Confidential | Internal | Public |
|------|------------|--------------|----------|---------|

| **developer** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **participant** | ❌ | Own Data Only | Own Data Only | ✅ |

## 4. Audit Trail Procedures

### 4.1 DOL Inquiry Response

**Procedure**: Systematic approach to responding to Department of Labor inquiries.

**Steps**:
1. **Scope Identification**: Determine time period, participants, and transaction types
2. **Data Extraction**: Query event store for relevant events
3. **History Reconstruction**: Rebuild participant account history
4. **Compliance Validation**: Run compliance checks on extracted data
5. **Report Generation**: Create formatted response package

**Response Time**: Target 5 business days for standard inquiries

### 4.2 Event Query Examples

```sql
-- Extract all contributions for a participant
SELECT
    event_id,
    event_timestamp,
    event_type,
    employee_id,
    payload->>'contribution_amount' as amount,
    payload->>'contribution_type' as type
FROM fct_yearly_events
WHERE employee_id = ?
  AND event_type = 'contribution'
  AND event_timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY event_timestamp;

-- Reconstruct account balance history
SELECT
    event_timestamp,
    event_type,
    payload->>'account_balance' as balance,
    payload->>'transaction_amount' as transaction
FROM fct_yearly_events
WHERE employee_id = ?
ORDER BY event_timestamp;
```

### 4.3 Data Retention Verification

```sql
-- Verify 7-year retention compliance
SELECT
    MIN(event_timestamp) as earliest_event,
    MAX(event_timestamp) as latest_event,
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    DATEDIFF('year', MIN(event_timestamp), CURRENT_DATE) as years_retained
FROM fct_yearly_events
WHERE years_retained >= 7;
```
