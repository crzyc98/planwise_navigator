# 🎉 **SUCCESS: Workforce Simulation Growth Issue RESOLVED!**

**Date**: June 24, 2025
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Impact**: Critical - Multi-year workforce simulation now achieving target growth rates

## **The Victory**
```
=== Multi-year simulation summary ===
Year 2025: 4510 employees, 3.0% growth ✅
Year 2026: 4645 employees, 3.0% growth ✅
Year 2027: 4780 employees, 2.9% growth ✅
Year 2028: 4922 employees, 3.0% growth ✅
Year 2029: 5066 employees, 2.9% growth ✅
```

**BEFORE**: Years 2026+ showed 0.0% growth (flat at 4508 employees)
**AFTER**: Consistent ~3% compound growth year-over-year! 🚀

---

## **Problem Summary**

The workforce simulation was not achieving target growth rates in out-years (2026+). While Year 2025 correctly achieved 3.0% growth, all subsequent years showed flat growth at approximately 4,508 employees, indicating the simulation was restarting from the wrong baseline each year instead of using the previous year's dynamically simulated ending workforce.

---

## **Root Cause Analysis: What Was Broken**

### **Problem 1: Critical Model Name Typo**
- **Location**: `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py` (lines 281, 916)
- **Issue**: Pipeline called `int_previous_year_workforce` (incorrect name)
- **Reality**: Actual dbt model was named `int_workforce_previous_year`
- **Impact**: Years 2026+ never updated workforce base, always defaulted to baseline 4,378 employees
- **Evidence**: `int_workforce_previous_year` consistently returned 4,378 (baseline count) instead of dynamic previous year results

### **Problem 2: Missing dbt Source Definition**
- **Location**: `dbt/models/` (missing source definition file)
- **Issue**: `int_workforce_previous_year.sql` referenced `{{ source('snapshots', 'scd_workforce_state') }}`
- **Reality**: No source definition existed for the snapshots schema
- **Impact**: dbt threw "Catalog 'main' does not exist" error, preventing model execution
- **Evidence**: Runtime errors in dbt logs when attempting to run the corrected model name

---

## **The Detective Work That Cracked the Case**

### **1. Data Investigation Revealed the Pattern**
```sql
-- Baseline workforce: 4,378 active employees
-- Year 2025 simulation: 4,510 active employees (✅ 3% growth)
-- Years 2026-2029: ALL 4,508 employees (❌ flat growth)
```

**Key Insight**: Year 2025 worked correctly (using baseline logic), but years 2026+ were identical, suggesting they weren't building on previous year results.

### **2. Snapshot Analysis Showed Data Disconnect**
```sql
-- fct_workforce_snapshot: 4,500+ employees per year (correct simulated results)
-- scd_workforce_state snapshot: ~650-4,600 employees (snapshot working)
-- int_workforce_previous_year: 4,378 employees (❌ baseline count, not previous year)
```

**Key Insight**: The snapshot mechanism was working, but `int_workforce_previous_year` wasn't using the snapshot data.

### **3. Pipeline Debugging Revealed the Smoking Gun**
Debug logs consistently showed:
```
📊 Starting workforce: 4,378 active employees  // ❌ Should be dynamic
```

For ALL years 2026+, proving the simulation was restarting from baseline every year.

**Expected progression**:
- Year 2025: Start with 4,378 → End with 4,510
- Year 2026: Start with 4,510 → End with ~4,645
- Year 2027: Start with 4,645 → End with ~4,780

### **4. Model Name Investigation Found the Typo**
```python
# BROKEN in simulator_pipeline.py:
"--select", "int_previous_year_workforce"  # ❌ Wrong model name

# CORRECT:
"--select", "int_workforce_previous_year"  # ✅ Actual model filename
```

**Key Insight**: The typo meant the correct model was never executed for years 2026+, so variables weren't passed and the model defaulted to baseline logic.

---

## **The Fix Implementation**

### **Fix 1: Corrected Model Name Typo**
**File**: `orchestrator/simulator_pipeline.py`
**Lines**: 276, 281, 291, 912, 916, 928

```python
# Updated in both run_year_simulation and run_multi_year_simulation functions:
- context.log.info(f"Running int_previous_year_workforce for year {year}")
+ context.log.info(f"Running int_workforce_previous_year for year {year}")

- "--select", "int_previous_year_workforce",
+ "--select", "int_workforce_previous_year",

- f"Failed to run int_previous_year_workforce for year {year}"
+ f"Failed to run int_workforce_previous_year for year {year}"
```

### **Fix 2: Created Missing Source Definition**
**File**: `dbt/models/sources.yml` (newly created)

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: snapshots
    description: "dbt snapshots schema containing historical workforce state"
    schema: main
    tables:
      - name: scd_workforce_state
        description: "Slowly changing dimension table capturing workforce state at the end of each simulation year"
        columns:
          - name: employee_id
            description: "Unique identifier for each employee"
          - name: simulation_year
            description: "Simulation year this snapshot represents"
          - name: employment_status
            description: "Employment status (active/terminated)"
          - name: dbt_valid_to
            description: "dbt snapshot valid to timestamp"
          # ... additional columns documented
```

## **What Made This Debugging Successful**

### **🔍 Systematic Data Flow Analysis**
1. **Started with symptoms**: Identified flat growth pattern in multi-year logs
2. **Traced data lineage**: `scd_workforce_state` → `int_workforce_previous_year` → workforce calculation
3. **Validated each step**: Found discrepancies between expected vs actual data counts
4. **Identified break points**: Model name mismatch + missing source definition

### **📊 Evidence-Driven Investigation**
- Used direct database queries to verify data at each transformation stage
- Compared baseline (4,378) vs simulated (4,510+) workforce counts across years
- Cross-referenced model names in filesystem vs pipeline execution calls
- Validated dbt source references vs actual schema definitions in database

### **🎯 Focused Problem Isolation**
- Separated configuration issues from business logic issues
- Distinguished between data persistence problems vs execution problems
- Identified that Year 2025 worked (✅) but 2026+ failed (❌)
- This pattern pointed to year-transition logic rather than core simulation algorithms

### **🔧 Methodical Fix Validation**
- Applied fixes incrementally to isolate impact of each change
- Verified each fix addressed its specific root cause
- Confirmed complete resolution with full end-to-end multi-year testing

## **Technical Architecture Insights**

### **Data Flow Design (Now Working Correctly)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Year N fct_workforce_snapshot] --> B[dbt snapshot scd_workforce_state]
    B --> C[int_workforce_previous_year for Year N+1]
    C --> D[Event Generation for Year N+1]
    D --> E[Year N+1 fct_workforce_snapshot]
```

### **Critical Dependencies Verified**
1. **Snapshot Timing**: Must run AFTER `fct_workforce_snapshot` completes for each year
2. **Variable Passing**: `simulation_year` must be correctly passed to `int_workforce_previous_year`
3. **Source Resolution**: dbt sources must be defined for all external table references
4. **Model Naming**: Exact model names must match between orchestration and dbt project

---

## **Key Learnings for Future Development**

### **1. Model Naming Consistency is Critical**
- Typos in model names cause silent failures in orchestration pipelines
- Always verify actual dbt model filenames vs pipeline references
- Consider implementing automated validation of model name consistency
- **Recommendation**: Add CI/CD checks to validate all `--select` model names exist

### **2. dbt Source Definitions Are Required for External References**
- `{{ source() }}` macro requires explicit source definitions in schema.yml files
- Missing sources cause cryptic "catalog does not exist" errors in dbt
- All external table dependencies must be properly documented
- **Recommendation**: Include source validation in dbt project health checks

### **3. Multi-Year State Management Needs Robust Validation**
- Year-over-year simulations require careful state handoff between iterations
- Debug logging of starting workforce counts is essential for troubleshooting
- Always verify previous year data exists and is accessible before proceeding
- **Recommendation**: Add automated assertions for year-transition data availability

### **4. Data Flow Validation Should Be Comprehensive**
- Check data counts and relationships at each transformation stage
- Verify snapshots capture expected data volumes and maintain referential integrity
- Cross-reference debug logs with actual database queries for consistency
- **Recommendation**: Implement data quality checks as part of the pipeline
