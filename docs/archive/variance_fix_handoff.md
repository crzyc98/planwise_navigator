# PlanWise Navigator: Termination Variance Fix - Technical Handoff

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Multi-year workforce simulation showing persistent growth variance (86-103 employees above target per year)
**Root Cause**: Multiple sources of probabilistic variance in termination and hiring calculations
**Status**: 85% Solved - Reduced variance from ~100 to ~10-60 employees per year
**Remaining Issue**: Cumulative compounding variance that grows over time (-3 → +57 employees)

## Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. Hybrid Experienced Termination Model (`int_termination_events.sql`)
**Problem**: Pure hazard-based model created 8.7x under-generation of terminations
**Solution**: Hybrid approach combining hazard-based + gap-filling terminations

```sql
-- BEFORE: Probabilistic only
WHERE random_value < termination_rate

-- AFTER: Deterministic hybrid
WITH target_calculation AS (
    SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) * 0.12) AS target_count
    FROM workforce_with_bands WHERE employee_type = 'experienced'
)
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ...) <= target_count
```

**Result**: Exactly 12% experienced termination rate every year

### 2. Deterministic New Hire Terminations (`int_new_hire_termination_events.sql`)
**Problem**: Probabilistic terminations created hiring/termination mismatch
**Solution**: Exact count selection instead of probability filtering

```sql
-- BEFORE: Probabilistic
WHERE random_value < termination_rate

-- AFTER: Deterministic
WITH target_calculation AS (
    SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) * 0.25) AS target_terminations
    FROM new_hires_cohort
)
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY random_value) <= target_terminations
```

**Result**: Exactly 25% new hire termination rate every year

### 3. Precise Hiring Calculation (`int_hiring_events.sql`)
**Problem**: Hiring formula used estimates instead of actual termination counts
**Solution**: Reference actual termination events for precise calculation

```sql
-- BEFORE: Estimated terminations
CEIL(workforce_count * 0.12) AS expected_terminations

-- AFTER: Actual terminations
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM int_termination_events
 WHERE simulation_year = current_year) AS actual_terminations
```

**Result**: Hiring precisely matches actual departures + growth target

### 4. Fixed Debug Output (`simulator_pipeline.py:228-231`)
**Problem**: Hiring debug showed wrong workforce count
**Solution**: Consistent use of `int_workforce_previous_year`

## Remaining Variance Sources ⚠️

### Primary Issue: Cumulative Compounding
**Pattern Observed**: Variance grows over time (-3 → +10 → +32 → +44 → +57)
**Root Cause**: Small rounding errors compound across years in workforce snapshots

### Potential Sources:

#### 1. Workforce Snapshot Precision
```sql
-- CHECK: scd_workforce_state snapshot logic
-- ISSUE: May lose/gain employees during year-to-year transitions
```

#### 2. Promotion Effects Not Accounted
```sql
-- CHECK: int_promotion_events impact on workforce count
-- ISSUE: Promotions don't change headcount but may affect growth calculations
```

#### 3. Multi-Year Dependency Chain
```sql
-- Year N workforce → Year N+1 baseline → Year N+1 calculations
-- ISSUE: Errors accumulate through int_workforce_previous_year
```

#### 4. Merit Increase Timing
```sql
-- CHECK: int_merit_events may affect workforce transitions
-- ISSUE: Salary changes might impact downstream calculations
```

## Investigation Plan 🔍

### Phase 1: Validate Current Fixes
```bash
# Test single year precision
dbt run --select int_termination_events int_hiring_events int_new_hire_termination_events \
  --vars '{simulation_year: 2030, target_growth_rate: 0.03, total_termination_rate: 0.12, new_hire_termination_rate: 0.25}'

# Verify exact counts match formula
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Year Workforce Tracking
```sql
-- Track workforce count at each transition point:
SELECT
  simulation_year,
  COUNT(*) as active_count,
  LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY simulation_year) as prev_count,
  COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY simulation_year) as actual_change
FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
WHERE employment_status = 'active'
GROUP BY simulation_year;
```

### Phase 3: Growth Target Reconciliation
```sql
-- Compare expected vs actual growth by component:
WITH growth_components AS (
  SELECT
    simulation_year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'hire' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as hires,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'termination' AND event_category = 'experienced_termination' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as exp_terms,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'termination' AND event_category = 'new_hire_termination' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as new_hire_terms
  FROM fct_yearly_events
  GROUP BY simulation_year
)
SELECT
  *,
  hires - exp_terms - new_hire_terms as net_change
FROM growth_components;
```

## Recommended Next Steps 🎯

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Validate Snapshot Logic**: Ensure `scd_workforce_state` preserves exact employee counts
2. **Check Promotion Impact**: Verify promotions don't affect headcount calculations
3. **Audit Year Transitions**: Trace workforce count through `int_workforce_previous_year`

### Medium-term Solutions:
1. **Add Workforce Reconciliation**: Insert validation checks between years
2. **Implement Growth Target Enforcement**: Force exact 3% growth regardless of rounding
3. **Create Variance Monitoring**: Add alerts for >5 employee variance

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Deterministic Snapshots**: Replace probabilistic components in all models
2. **Precision-First Architecture**: Design for exact mathematical outcomes
3. **Automated Variance Correction**: Self-adjusting formulas for perfect precision
