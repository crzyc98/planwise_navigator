# PlanWise Navigator: From Foundation to Production

## A Strategic Roadmap for Platform Hardening and Deployment

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Author:** Strategic Analysis (Claude Code + Gemini AI)
**Status:** Critical analysis complete. Immediate focus required on platform stabilization.

-----

## 1. Executive Summary: At-a-Glance

| Overall Status | Completion Rate | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üü° **Foundation Complete, Blocked for Production** | **73%** (148/202 Story Points) | **STABILIZE & HARDEN FIRST** |

This platform is a world-class workforce simulation engine with a powerful, event-driven architecture and a sophisticated optimization framework. Core infrastructure is largely built and production-ready.

However, the platform stands at a **critical inflection point**. Significant gaps in mathematical accuracy and quality assurance present an unacceptable risk for production deployment. The powerful features we have built must be **trustworthy and reliable** before we introduce new capabilities.

> **A forecast based on flawed math is worse than no forecast at all.**

### Immediate Priorities: The Path to Production Readiness

1.  **Fix Critical Bugs (E011):** Address the growth calculation errors that corrupt multi-year forecasts. Mathematical accuracy is non-negotiable.
2.  **Build a Safety Net (E014):** Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline and testing strategy to prevent future regressions.
3.  **Enable Observability (E002):** Complete the operational monitoring framework to detect and alert on production failures.

-----

## 2. Comprehensive Capability Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Completed & Production-Ready**

  * **Event Sourcing Architecture (100%):** A robust, SOX-compliant foundation with immutable event logs (`fct_yearly_events`) that allows for perfect auditability and workforce history reconstruction.
  * **3-Tier dbt Data Pipeline (100%):** 25 production-grade dbt models with comprehensive testing, incremental materialization, and built-in data quality monitoring.
  * **Advanced Optimization Framework (100%):** A SciPy-based, thread-safe optimization engine that supports multi-objective tuning and has been successfully stress-tested.

### ‚ùå **Critical Gaps Blocking Deployment**

  * **Quality Assurance & Testing (30% Complete):**
      * **The Gap:** The current reliance on manual testing is unsustainable and high-risk. There is no automated CI/CD pipeline to enforce quality.
      * **The Risk:** A high probability of new bugs reaching production, eroding user trust and accumulating technical debt.
  * **Mathematical Accuracy (70% Complete):**
      * **The Gap:** Confirmed bugs in growth rate and cumulative workforce calculations invalidate simulation results.
      * **The Risk:** Incorrect workforce projections will lead to poor strategic business decisions.
  * **Operational Monitoring (60% Complete):**
      * **The Gap:** The platform lacks a centralized health dashboard and automated alerting for pipeline failures.
      * **The Risk:** Silent data corruption or pipeline failures could go undetected for extended periods.

## 4. Immediate Priority Roadmap (The Next 6 Weeks)

Our sole focus is to move the platform from "feature complete" to "**production stable**."

### **Weeks 1-3: Remediate & Configure**

#### 1. Epic E011-Enhanced: Mathematical Accuracy Remediation

  * **Priority:** **CRITICAL**
  * **Goal:** Ensure all simulation outputs are mathematically sound and align with expected growth targets.
  * **Success Metric:** Achieve 3% annual growth target within a ¬±0.5% tolerance across all test scenarios.

#### 2. Task: Populate and Validate Configuration

  * **Priority:** **HIGH**
  * **Goal:** Populate all necessary configuration files (`comp_levers.csv`, etc.) and create operational runbooks.
  * **Success Metric:** A developer can stand up a new, fully functional environment using only documentation.

### **Weeks 4-6: Automate & Monitor**

#### 3. Epic E014-Enhanced: Implement Foundational CI/CD

  * **Priority:** **CRITICAL**
  * **Goal:** Build an automated pipeline that enforces code quality and runs critical tests on every change.
  * **Success Metric:** CI pipeline executes in <2 minutes; no PR can be merged without passing all checks.

#### 4. Epic E002-Complete: Full Operational Monitoring

  * **Priority:** **HIGH**
  * **Goal:** Implement automated alerting for pipeline failures and a health dashboard for at-a-glance status checks.
  * **Success Metric:** 100% of pipeline failures trigger an immediate notification (Slack/Email).

## 10. Conclusion & Next Steps

PlanWise Navigator possesses a technically superior foundation. It is a significant asset that can provide a decisive competitive advantage in strategic workforce planning.

However, its sophistication is currently undermined by critical reliability gaps. Our immediate and undivided attention must be on the stabilization phase.

### Immediate Action Plan:

1.  **This Week:** Convene leads for Platform Engineering and DevOps to formally kick off Epics E011 and E014.
2.  **This Week:** Begin work to fix the primary growth calculation bug in `int_hiring_events.sql`.
3.  **By End of Month:** Have the foundational CI/CD pipeline running, including automated linting, formatting, and dbt tests.
4.  **Week 4:** Mathematical validation complete with 80% test coverage baseline.
5.  **Week 12:** GA Release decision based on SLI performance (‚â•99% target).

## Call to Action

**Commit to hardening now, or accept strategic drift later.**

PlanWise Navigator has the potential to be the definitive workforce simulation platform. The foundation is world-class, but we must choose: **stabilize and ship**, or risk credibility with flawed forecasts.

By executing this 90-day hardening plan, we will transform a powerful prototype into an unassailable enterprise asset that executives can bet the business on.
