Prefect OSS v3 Migration Assessment for PlanWise Navigator
Executive Summary
Recommendation: Proceed with caution. Prefect OSS v3 would require significant architectural changes that may not align with your current asset-centric approach.

Key Findings
1. dbt Orchestration Capabilities

Strong: Native prefect-dbt integration with enhanced logging, failure handling, and event emission.

Good: Automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient dbt failures.

Excellent: Single Python file approach (no YAML/shell scripts needed).

Limitation: Less sophisticated than Dagster's native dbt asset integration.

2. Dependency Management & Visualization

Major Change: Prefect v3 moved away from static DAGs to dynamic, runtime-resolved workflows.

Trade-off: More flexible but less predictable dependency visualization compared to Dagster.

Challenge: Your current 66-model dependency chain would lose the clear asset lineage that Dagster provides.

Risk: Harder to troubleshoot complex multi-year simulation dependencies.

3. Error Handling & Observability

Excellent: 90% reduction in runtime overhead in v3.

Strong: Transactional semantics with automatic rollback capabilities.

Good: Event-driven backend now open-sourced in v3.

Solid: Comprehensive logging and monitoring through the Prefect UI.

4. Performance for Data Pipelines

Outstanding: Demonstrated 73%+ cost reductions in real implementations.

Excellent: Up to 90% reduction in runtime overhead vs Prefect v2.

Good: Proven compatibility with DuckDB in production environments.

Strong: Horizontal scaling capabilities for multi-year simulations.

5. Learning Curve & Migration Complexity

High Complexity: Fundamental paradigm shift from asset-centric (Dagster) to task-centric (Prefect).

Major Refactor: 66 dbt models would need to be re-orchestrated as Python tasks.

Data Lineage Loss: Would lose Dagster's built-in asset dependency visualization.

Development Momentum: Prefect's contribution activity has declined since 2021.

6. Multi-Year Simulation Fit

Good: Dynamic parameter handling through native Python control flow.

Strong: Transactional semantics ensure data integrity across long simulations.

Excellent: Idempotency built-in for safe reruns.

Concern: Less mature ecosystem for complex data pipeline orchestration.

7. Integration & Operational Overhead

Good: Native DuckDB compatibility demonstrated in production.

Strong: Pure Python approach aligns with existing codebase.

Low: Minimal operational overhead as an open-source solution.

Risk: Would lose tight dbt-Dagster asset integration currently in use.

Migration Plan (If Proceeding)
Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2-3 weeks)

Create a minimal Prefect workflow for a single-year simulation.

Test dbt integration with current model dependencies.

Validate dynamic parameter handling for simulation_year.

Benchmark performance against the current Dagster implementation.

Phase 2: Architecture Redesign (4-6 weeks)

Redesign the 66-model dependency chain as Prefect tasks.

Implement custom data lineage tracking (to replace what is lost from Dagster).

Migrate existing asset checks to Prefect task validation.

Create a new observability dashboard for pipeline monitoring.

Phase 3: Full Migration (6-8 weeks)

Migrate all simulation years (2025-2030) to Prefect workflows.

Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic.

Conduct performance optimization and testing.

Complete team training and documentation.

Risk Assessment
High Risks

Loss of Data Lineage: Dagster's asset-centric approach provides superior visibility.

Complex Migration: Fundamental architectural changes are required.

Ecosystem Maturity: Prefect has a smaller data engineering ecosystem than Dagster.

Medium Risks

Development Momentum: Declining contribution activity in the Prefect project.

Learning Curve: The team would need to learn new orchestration paradigms.

Dependency Visualization: Runtime-resolved dependencies are harder to debug.

Low Risks

Performance: Prefect v3 shows excellent performance improvements.

Cost: Open-source with demonstrated cost savings.

DuckDB Integration: Well-established compatibility.

Recommendation
Hold on Migration - While Prefect OSS v3 offers compelling performance improvements and cost benefits, the fundamental paradigm shift from Dagster's asset-centric approach to Prefect's task-centric approach would require substantial re-architecting of your 66-model dbt pipeline.

Alternative Approach: Consider addressing current Dagster issues through:

Upgrading to the latest Dagster version with improved dbt integration.

Refactoring circular dependencies within the current architecture.

Implementing better error handling in existing Dagster assets.

Optimizing current dependency chains before considering migration.

If Migration is Required: Prefect v3 would be a viable option, but budget 12-17 weeks for a full migration with significant architectural changes.
