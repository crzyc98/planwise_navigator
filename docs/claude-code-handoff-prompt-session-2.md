# Claude Code Session Handoff - Epic E012 Phase 2B

**Session Date**: 2025-06-24
**Epic**: E012: Compensation System Integrity Fix
**Current Phase**: 2B - Compensation Growth Calibration
**Current Story**: S052 - Policy Parameter Optimization Testing

## Executive Status Summary

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

#### S050: Compensation Dilution Root Cause Analysis (COMPLETE)
- **Critical Discovery**: Confirmed fundamental merit calculation bug in `fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`
- **Bug Impact**: 2.7% overstatement of prorated compensation for merit recipients
- **Key Finding**: Merit increases applied to full year instead of proper time-weighted periods
- **Evidence**: Employee NEW_900000059 shows $238,494 actual vs $232,329 expected
- **Primary Dilution Driver**: New hire volume (13.7%-17.6%) with $12K-$20K prorated compensation
- **Overall Impact**: Volatile growth (-9.19% to +2.07%) vs target 2%

#### S051: Compensation Growth Calibration Framework (COMPLETE)
- **‚úÖ Multiple Calculation Methodologies**: Implemented and validated
  - Method A (Current): 1.36% growth, needs +3% policy adjustment
  - Method B (Continuous): -2.25% growth, confirms merit bug impact
  - Method C (Full-Year Equiv): 8.95% growth, eliminates dilution
- **‚úÖ Target Validation Logic**: 2% ¬± 0.5% assessment working correctly
- **‚úÖ Dilution Impact Modeling**: Quantifies 3.6 percentage point new hire dilution
- **‚úÖ Policy Adjustment Framework**: Calculates required parameter changes
- **‚úÖ Automated Analysis**: Framework runs across all simulation years

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS WORK

#### S052: Policy Parameter Optimization Testing (IN PROGRESS)
- **‚úÖ Policy Test Matrix**: 35 scenarios designed (5 COLA rates √ó 7 Merit budgets)
- **‚úÖ Test Scenarios Configuration**: `policy_test_scenarios.yaml` created with all combinations
- **‚úÖ Framework Design**: `fct_policy_optimization.sql` created
- **‚ùå SQL Implementation Issue**: Encountering nested aggregate function errors
- **Next Step**: Fix SQL aggregation issues and execute systematic parameter testing

## Current Technical Status

### Working Components
1. **Database**: simulation.duckdb with 5-year simulation data (2025-2029)
2. **Baseline Analysis**: `fct_compensation_growth.sql` working correctly
3. **Configuration**: `simulation_config.yaml` updated with growth targets
4. **Test Scenarios**: 35 policy combinations ready for testing

### Blocked Components
1. **Policy Testing Model**: `fct_policy_optimization.sql` has SQL errors
   - Issue: Nested aggregate functions in GROUP BY clauses
   - Error: "aggregate function calls cannot be nested"
   - Location: Lines around ANY_VALUE() usage in methodology calculations

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- ‚úÖ `docs/s050-compensation-dilution-analysis.md` (updated with bug confirmation)
- ‚úÖ `docs/s051-compensation-growth-calibration-framework.md` (complete)
- ‚úÖ `docs/s052-policy-parameter-optimization.md` (framework design)
- ‚úÖ `config/simulation_config.yaml` (added growth targets)
- ‚úÖ `config/policy_test_scenarios.yaml` (35 test scenarios)
- ‚úÖ `dbt/models/marts/fct_compensation_growth.sql` (working)
- ‚ùå `dbt/models/marts/fct_policy_optimization.sql` (SQL errors need fixing)

## Immediate Next Actions for S052

### Priority 1: Fix SQL Implementation
**Problem**: `fct_policy_optimization.sql` has nested aggregate issues
**Solution Approach**:
1. Restructure SQL to avoid GROUP BY with cross-joined configuration data
2. Create separate CTEs for configuration and calculation phases
3. Use simpler parameter passing approach

### Priority 2: Execute Policy Testing
**Goal**: Test all 35 COLA/Merit combinations across methodologies
**Expected Outcomes**:
- Identify 3-5 scenarios achieving 2% ¬± 0.5% growth target
- Rank by efficiency (minimal policy adjustment)
- Validate sustainability across multiple years

### Priority 3: Results Analysis
**Deliverables for S053**:
- Optimization results matrix (70 total tests: 35 scenarios √ó 2 methodologies)
- Top policy combination recommendations
- Trade-off analysis (COLA vs Merit emphasis)
- Budget impact assessment

## Strategic Context for Next Session

### Business Objective
Achieve sustained 2% annual compensation growth through optimal COLA/Merit policy calibration

### Technical Challenge
Merit calculation bug creates 2.7% overstatement baseline, but new hire dilution (-3.6 percentage points) is the primary driver requiring policy adjustment

### Framework Approach
- **Method A (Current)**: Requires ~3% policy boost to reach target
- **Method C (Full-Year)**: Already exceeds target, may need reduction
- **Test Matrix**: Systematic testing from conservative (2.5% COLA, 4% Merit) to aggressive (4.5% COLA, 10% Merit)

### Success Criteria
- ‚â•3 scenarios achieve 1.5%-2.5% growth consistently
- ‚â•1 scenario requires minimal adjustment (<2 percentage points)
- All scenarios within realistic HR budget constraints

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Proceed with policy calibration using current (overstated) baseline** - 2.7% bug impact is consistent and smaller than dilution effects
2. **Focus on Methods A and C** - Method B excluded due to negative growth indicating calculation issues
3. **Systematic testing approach** - 35 scenarios provide comprehensive coverage of feasible policy space

## Ready to Continue

The framework is solid and the approach is validated. Next session should focus on:
1. **Quick SQL fix** for policy optimization model (30 minutes)
2. **Systematic testing execution** across all scenarios (1 hour)
3. **Results analysis and recommendations** for S053 (1 hour)

Epic E012 Phase 2B is on track for completion with clear path to 2% compensation growth target achievement.
