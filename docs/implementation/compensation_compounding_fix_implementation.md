# Compensation Compounding Fix Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Status**: Enhanced with Time-Weighted Calculations
**Priority**: Critical Fix

## Executive Summary

This document details the implementation of a comprehensive fix to ensure compensation raises compound correctly across simulation years in the PlanWise Navigator workforce simulation system. The solution includes a new time-weighted compensation calculation system that provides more accurate year-over-year compensation carryforward by accounting for the actual timing of raises throughout the year, replacing the simple full-year equivalent approach.

## Problem Description

### Root Cause
The original issue was located in `dbt/models/intermediate/int_workforce_previous_year_v2.sql` where the model was using `full_year_equivalent_compensation` for year-over-year carryforward. However, this approach was imprecise because it didn't account for the actual time periods employees spent at different salary levels throughout the year.

**Original Problem**: Employees with mid-year raises would have their next year's starting salary calculated as if they received the full raise amount for the entire year, when they actually only received it for part of the year.

**Enhanced Solution**: Implemented a time-weighted compensation calculation that accounts for actual time periods at different salary levels, providing more accurate compensation carryforward.

### Impact Analysis
The time-weighted approach provides more accurate compensation calculations compared to the full-year equivalent method:

**Example**: Employee starting at $176,000 with 4.3% raise on March 1st:

| Method | Calculation | 2025 Compensation | Next Year Starting Salary |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Full-Year Equivalent** | $176,000 × 1.043 | $183,568.00 | $183,568.00 |
| **Time-Weighted** | (59 days × $176,000) + (306 days × $183,568) ÷ 365 | $182,308.44 | $182,308.44 |
| **Difference** | More accurate timing | -$1,259.56 | -$1,259.56 |

**Benefits of Time-Weighted Approach**:
- More accurate reflection of actual compensation earned
- Better alignment with payroll reality
- Improved year-over-year carryforward precision
- Reduced artificial inflation of compensation growth

## Solution Implementation

### 1. New Time-Weighted Compensation Model

**File**: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_time_weighted_compensation.sql` (NEW)

Created a dedicated model that calculates actual compensation earned throughout each year based on raise events:

**Key Features**:
- Extracts compensation events from `fct_yearly_events` where `event_category = 'RAISE'`
- Creates time periods between raise events (start of year → first raise → second raise → end of year)
- Calculates compensation for each period: `period_salary × (days_in_period / 365.0)`
- Handles edge cases: new hires, terminations, multiple raises, employees with no raises
- Provides validation metadata and calculation method tracking

**Logic Flow**:
```sql
-- Period 1: January 1 - March 1 (59 days) at starting salary
-- Period 2: March 1 - December 31 (306 days) at post-raise salary
-- Time-weighted total: (starting_salary × 59/365) + (ending_salary × 306/365)
```

### 2. Enhanced int_workforce_previous_year_v2.sql

**File**: `dbt/models/intermediate/int_workforce_previous_year_v2.sql`
**Change**: Updated to use time-weighted compensation with fallback logic

```sql
-- BEFORE (Full-Year Equivalent)
full_year_equivalent_compensation AS employee_gross_compensation,

-- AFTER (Time-Weighted with Fallback)
COALESCE(twc.actual_time_weighted_compensation, fws.current_compensation) AS employee_gross_compensation,
```

Added LEFT JOIN to `int_time_weighted_compensation` with fallback to current compensation for data quality resilience.

### 3. Enhanced Data Flow Architecture

The time-weighted approach introduces a new calculation layer:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[fct_yearly_events Year N] --> B[int_time_weighted_compensation]
    C[fct_workforce_snapshot Year N] --> D[int_workforce_previous_year_v2]
    B --> D
    D --> E[int_merit_events Year N+1]
    E --> F[fct_yearly_events Year N+1]
    F --> G[fct_workforce_snapshot Year N+1]

    A --> |"RAISE events with<br/>effective_date and<br/>compensation_amount"| B
    B --> |"actual_time_weighted_compensation<br/>(accounts for timing)"| D
    C --> |"workforce snapshot<br/>(fallback data)"| D
    D --> |"employee_gross_compensation<br/>(time-weighted starting salary)"| E
    E --> |"Merit events with<br/>accurate baseline"| F
    F --> |"Events with proper<br/>time-weighted foundation"| G
```

### 4. Enhanced Validation Framework

#### Updated SQL Validation Model
**File**: `dbt/models/analysis/test_compensation_compounding_validation.sql` (ENHANCED)

Enhanced validation queries now include:
- **Time-Weighted Validation**: Validates that time-weighted compensation falls within expected ranges
- **Carryforward Accuracy**: Tests that Year N+1 starting salaries match Year N time-weighted compensation
- **Method Validation**: Ensures appropriate calculation methods are used (time_weighted_with_raises vs full_year_no_raises)
- **Edge Case Testing**: Validates employees with multiple raises, new hires, and terminations
- **Quality Flags**: Identifies potential data quality issues in time-weighted calculations

#### Python Validation Script
**File**: `scripts/validate_compensation_compounding.py`

Automated validation script that:
- Runs multi-year simulations to verify compensation compounding
- Tracks specific employee examples through the simulation
- Generates detailed pass/fail reports with specific examples
- Tests the $176,000 employee case mentioned in requirements

#### Enhanced Integration Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/test_compensation_compounding_fix.py` (ENHANCED)

Comprehensive test suite now covering:
- **Time-Weighted Calculation Tests**: Validates accurate compensation calculation for mid-year raises
- **Multiple Raises Scenarios**: Tests employees with promotion and merit raises in the same year
- **Carryforward Accuracy Tests**: Ensures time-weighted compensation carries forward correctly

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring

#### Updated fct_compensation_growth.sql
**File**: `dbt/models/marts/fct_compensation_growth.sql`

Added new compounding validation section that:
- Tracks individual employee compensation progression across years
- Validates that starting salaries in Year N+1 match ending salaries from Year N
- Calculates compounding accuracy metrics
- Identifies employees with broken compounding chains
- Provides summary statistics on compounding effectiveness

#### Enhanced Analysis Script
**File**: `scripts/analyze_compensation_growth.py`

Added `analyze_compounding_behavior()` function that:
- Tracks individual employees across simulation years
- Identifies employees where compensation is not compounding properly
- Provides specific examples of correct vs incorrect compounding
- Shows the $176,000 employee case validation
- Calculates percentage of employees with proper compounding

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Incorrect Behavior)
- Employees start each year with the same pre-raise salary
- Raises apply to the original baseline each year
- No compounding effect over time
- Significant lost compensation for long-term employees

### After Fix (Correct Behavior)
- Employees start each year with previous year's post-raise salary
- Raises apply to the compounded compensation base
- True compounding effect achieved
- Proper compensation growth trajectory

### Validation Thresholds
- **Excellent**: ≥95% of employees have correct compounding
- **Good**: ≥90% of employees have correct compounding
- **Poor**: <90% of employees have correct compounding

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Validate the SQL field change in isolation
- Test with known employee data and expected outcomes

### 2. Integration Tests
- Multi-year simulation testing
- Employee progression tracking
- Edge case validation

### 3. Validation Queries
- Real-time compounding accuracy monitoring
- Automated detection of compounding issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```sql
   -- Revert line 33 in int_workforce_previous_year_v2.sql
   current_compensation AS employee_gross_compensation,
   ```

2. **Re-run Affected Models**:
   ```bash
   dbt run --select int_workforce_previous_year_v2+
   ```

3. **Validation**:
   - Run validation queries to confirm rollback
   - Check that previous behavior is restored

## Future Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Include compounding validation in regular data quality checks
- Set up alerts for compounding accuracy below 95%
- Monitor `total_lost_compensation` metric

### Regression Prevention
- Add compounding validation to CI/CD pipeline
- Require compounding tests to pass before model deployment
- Regular audits of compensation progression logic
