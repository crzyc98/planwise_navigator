# Promotion Compensation State Management Fix

## Problem Statement

**Critical workforce simulation issue**: Promotion events were using stale baseline compensation instead of current end-of-year compensation, violating fundamental workforce simulation continuity principles.

### Specific Issue Example (EMP_000012)
```
Timeline:
2025-07-15: Merit $87,300 → $91,922.01
2026-07-15: Merit $91,922.01 → $96,788.73
2027-07-15: Merit $96,788.73 → $101,913.12
2028-02-01: Promotion previous_compensation = $87,300 ❌ (Should be $101,913.12)
```

**Impact**: Promotions were using 4-year-old compensation data, breaking workforce state progression and causing inaccurate simulation results.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the temporal data flow between workforce snapshots and promotion event generation:

1. **`int_promotion_events.sql`**: Used `current_compensation` from previous year's `fct_workforce_snapshot`
2. **`int_active_employees_prev_year_snapshot.sql`**: Also used `current_compensation` for workforce transitions
3. **Problem**: `current_compensation` represents start-of-year salary, not end-of-year salary after merit increases

### Data Flow Issue
```
fct_workforce_snapshot (Year N-1):
├── current_compensation: $87,300 (start-of-year)
├── full_year_equivalent_compensation: $101,913.12 (end-of-year, includes merit)
└── Promotion events incorrectly used current_compensation ❌
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Updated `int_promotion_events.sql`

**Changed Line 48**:
```sql
-- OLD (INCORRECT):
current_compensation AS employee_gross_compensation,

-- NEW (FIXED):
full_year_equivalent_compensation AS employee_gross_compensation,
```

**Rationale**: `full_year_equivalent_compensation` includes all merit increases from the previous year, ensuring promotions use actual end-of-year compensation.

### 2. Updated `int_active_employees_prev_year_snapshot.sql`

**Changed Line 47**:
```sql
-- OLD (INCORRECT):
current_compensation as employee_gross_compensation,

-- NEW (FIXED):
full_year_equivalent_compensation as employee_gross_compensation,
```

**Rationale**: Maintains compensation continuity across year transitions for all event generation.

## Validation Framework

### Created Test: `test_promotion_compensation_continuity.sql`

Validates that:
- Promotion events use `full_year_equivalent_compensation` from previous year
- No promotions use stale `current_compensation` data
- Financial impact assessment for any remaining discrepancies

### Data Quality Monitoring

Existing monitoring model `data_quality_promotion_compensation.sql` will now detect:
- **CORRECT**: `promotion_previous_salary` matches `full_year_equivalent_compensation`
- **INCORRECT**: Any remaining usage of stale compensation data
- **Gap Analysis**: Financial impact of compensation continuity issues

## Expected Results After Fix

### EMP_000012 Corrected Timeline
```
2025-07-15: Merit $87,300 → $91,922.01
2026-07-15: Merit $91,922.01 → $96,788.73
2027-07-15: Merit $96,788.73 → $101,913.12
2028-02-01: Promotion previous_compensation = $101,913.12 ✅ (FIXED)
2028-07-15: Merit uses post-promotion salary ✅ (Downstream benefit)
```

### Simulation Integrity Improvements

1. **Zero Tolerance**: No stale compensation data in promotion calculations
2. **Workforce Continuity**: All promotions reflect actual workforce progression
3. **Merit History Preservation**: Promotions account for all previous merit increases
4. **Temporal Consistency**: Calendar-driven events maintain causal relationships

## Technical Implementation Details

### Compensation Field Semantics

| Field | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `current_compensation` | Start-of-year baseline salary | ❌ Should not be used for promotions |
| `full_year_equivalent_compensation` | End-of-year salary (includes merit) | ✅ Correct for promotions |
| `prorated_annual_compensation` | Actual earned during year | Used for payroll calculations |

### Calendar-Driven Event Sequence

1. **Merit Events**: July 15th (establish end-of-year compensation)
2. **Promotion Events**: February 1st next year (use end-of-year compensation)
3. **Dependency**: Promotions depend on completed merit calculations

### Performance Impact

- **No Performance Degradation**: Both fields exist in same snapshot table
- **Index Usage**: Existing indexes on `employee_id` and `simulation_year` remain optimal
- **Memory Footprint**: No additional data loading required

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Updated `int_promotion_events.sql` to use `full_year_equivalent_compensation`
- [x] Updated `int_active_employees_prev_year_snapshot.sql` for consistency
- [x] Created validation test `test_promotion_compensation_continuity.sql`
- [x] Updated documentation comments in affected models
- [ ] Run full simulation test for EMP_000012 validation
- [ ] Execute data quality monitoring to confirm zero violations
- [ ] Validate multi-year simulation consistency

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Zero Violations**: `data_quality_promotion_compensation` should show no `MAJOR_VIOLATION` or `CRITICAL_VIOLATION` cases
2. **Compensation Continuity**: All promotion `previous_compensation` values should match previous year's `full_year_equivalent_compensation`
3. **Merit Propagation**: Merit events should properly flow into promotion calculations

### Success Criteria

- EMP_000012 promotion in 2028 uses $101,913.12 (not $87,300)
- All promotion events show `compensation_source_validation = 'CORRECT_USES_FULL_YEAR_EQUIVALENT'`
- Zero entries in validation test query results
- Workforce simulation variance within acceptable bounds (<0.5%)

This fix ensures that PlanWise Navigator maintains enterprise-grade workforce simulation integrity with accurate compensation state management across all temporal transitions.
