## 1. Executive Summary

PlanWise Navigator is Fidelity's on-premises workforce simulation platform that models employee lifecycle events (hiring, promotions, raises, terminations) to project future workforce composition and costs. This document defines the **production-ready system** built using a modern, proven data stack with **modular architecture** achieved through Epic E013.

### Key Objectives

- **Project** headcount, compensation costs, and organizational structure changes
- **Analyze** impact of policy changes (promotion rates, termination rates, hiring targets)
- **Deliver** interactive dashboards and reports for strategic decision-making

### Critical Constraints
- **On-premises only**: No cloud dependencies, all processing local
- **DuckDB serialization**: Must handle DuckDB's non-serializable objects correctly ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Proven stack only**: Use stable, tested versions to minimize risk ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Modular architecture**: Maintainable, testable pipeline components ✅ **ACHIEVED** (Epic E013)

## 5. Technical Constraints & Design Decisions

### 5.1 Critical Technical Constraints

1. **DuckDB Serialization**: DuckDB Relation objects are NOT serializable by Dagster
   - ✅ **Solution**: Always convert to pandas DataFrames or Python primitives
   - ✅ **Pattern**: Use context managers for all connections
   - ❌ **Never**: Return DuckDBPyRelation from Dagster assets

2. **Version Compatibility**: Proven stable versions only
   - ~~DuckDB 1.1.x~~ → DuckDB 1.0.0 (stability issues resolved)
   - ~~dbt-core 1.9.x~~ → dbt-core 1.8.8 (adapter compatibility)
   - ~~dagster latest~~ → dagster 1.8.12 (API stability)

3. **Memory Management**: Handle large datasets efficiently
   - Batch processing for > 50K records
   - Streaming reads for analytical queries
   - Connection pooling with proper cleanup

### 5.2 Key Design Patterns

```python
# REQUIRED: DuckDB Asset Pattern
@asset
def workforce_data(context: AssetExecutionContext, duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> pd.DataFrame:
    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        # ✅ CORRECT: Convert immediately to DataFrame
        df = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM employees").df()
        return df  # Serializable

# ❌ WRONG: Never do this
@asset
def broken_asset():
    conn = duckdb.connect("db.duckdb")
    return conn.table("employees")  # DuckDBPyRelation - NOT SERIALIZABLE!
```

|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Real-time data streaming | Batch processing sufficient for use case | v3.0 if needed |
| Cloud deployment | Security requires on-premises | Not planned |
| Mobile app | Desktop analytics sufficient | Not planned |
| AI/ML predictions | Hazard tables provide needed accuracy | v2.0 evaluation |
| Multi-tenant isolation | Single-tenant design simpler | If multi-dept needed |
| External API integration | Self-contained system required | Case-by-case basis |

---

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Simulation accuracy | N/A | < 5% variance from actuals | 6 months |
| User adoption | 0% | 80% of analysts | 3 months post-launch |
