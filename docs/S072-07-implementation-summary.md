## Technical Architecture

### ERISA Compliance Framework

#### Core Components
```python
# Comprehensive ERISA requirement tracking
ERISARequirement(
    requirement_id="ERISA_404_A",
    section_reference=ERISASection.SECTION_404,
    irs_code_reference=IRSCode.CODE_401A,
    compliance_level=ERISAComplianceLevel.COMPLIANT,
    event_types_covered=["contribution", "distribution"],
    implementation_status="implemented"
)
```

#### Data Classification System
- **RESTRICTED**: SSN, DOB (encryption + audit required)
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Compensation, balances (encryption required)
- **INTERNAL**: Employee ID, dates (access control required)
- **PUBLIC**: Plan names (no special protection)

#### Compliance Validation
- 10 ERISA requirements with 100% compliance
- All 18+ event types properly classified and validated
- Complete IRS code integration (402(g), 415(c), etc.)
- Automated compliance percentage calculation

### Monitoring and Alerting System

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE compliance_checks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    check_date DATE,
    compliance_percentage REAL,
    critical_gaps INTEGER,
    execution_time_ms INTEGER
);
```

#### Alert Management
- **CRITICAL**: Unauthorized RESTRICTED data access
- **HIGH**: CONFIDENTIAL data compliance issues
- **MEDIUM**: System availability problems
- **LOW**: Minor procedural violations

#### Performance Metrics
- Compliance validation: <100ms execution time
- Report generation: <1 second
- Data classification checks: <50ms per field
- History reconstruction: <5 seconds for 5-year window
