## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Data Quality Validation Queries

The framework executes comprehensive SQL validation queries against the DuckDB simulation database:

1. **UUID Uniqueness Check**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_events, COUNT(DISTINCT event_uuid) as unique_uuids
   FROM fct_yearly_events
   WHERE simulation_year BETWEEN ? AND ?
   ```

2. **Workforce Conservation Validation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT simulation_year, COUNT(*) as workforce_count,
          SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'hire' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as total_hires,
          SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'termination' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as total_terminations
   FROM fct_yearly_events
   WHERE simulation_year BETWEEN ? AND ?
   GROUP BY simulation_year ORDER BY simulation_year
   ```

3. **Compensation Analysis**:
   ```sql
   SELECT simulation_year, MIN(year_end_comp), MAX(year_end_comp),
          AVG(year_end_comp), STDDEV(year_end_comp)
   FROM fct_workforce_snapshot
   WHERE simulation_year BETWEEN ? AND ? AND year_end_comp > 0
   GROUP BY simulation_year ORDER BY simulation_year
   ```

### Statistical Analysis

- **Correlation Coefficients**: Calculated using either numpy or custom implementation
- **Performance Variance**: Standard deviation of performance ratios
- **Mean Absolute Error**: Average difference between baseline and comparison
