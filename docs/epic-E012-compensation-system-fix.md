# Epic E012: Compensation System Integrity Fix

**Epic Owner**: System Architecture Team
**Sprint**: TBD (Next Available)
**Priority**: Must Have (Critical System Integrity)
**Estimated Effort**: 18 story points

## Problem Statement

Critical compensation calculation errors in the workforce simulation are causing unrealistic salary assignments and distorted analytics. The root cause is extreme `max_compensation` values in `config_job_levels.csv` (Level 4: $10M, Level 5: $15M) that create massive average compensation calculations, resulting in new hires with million-dollar salaries.

### Impact Analysis

- **Current State**: New hire average compensation shows $18K (artificially low due to proration of inflated base salaries)
- **Actual Issue**: Level 4/5 new hires assigned $5M+ base salaries that get prorated down
- **Business Impact**: All compensation analytics are distorted, making financial projections unreliable
- **Technical Debt**: Compensation logic propagates errors across multiple models

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Source Data Quality
- `config_job_levels.csv` contains unrealistic max_compensation values
- Level 4: $10,000,000 (should be ~$300,000)
- Level 5: $15,000,000 (should be ~$500,000)

### Secondary Issue: Calculation Logic
- `int_hiring_events.sql` lines 120-126: avg_compensation calculation uses uncapped values
- Even though caps exist (lines 114-117), the average formula bypasses them
- Formula: `(min_compensation + max_compensation) / 2` results in $5M+ averages

### Propagation Path
```
config_job_levels.csv (bad data)
  ↓
stg_config_job_levels.sql (passes through uncapped)
  ↓
int_hiring_events.sql compensation_ranges CTE (avg_compensation inflated)
  ↓
new_hire_assignments (million-dollar salaries assigned)
  ↓
fct_workforce_snapshot.sql (prorated compensation distorted)
```

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Quality Fix
1. **Source Data Correction**: Update `config_job_levels.csv` with realistic compensation ranges
2. **Validation**: Ensure compensation progression remains logical across all levels

### Phase 2: Calculation Logic Enhancement
1. **Average Calculation Fix**: Update `int_hiring_events.sql` to use capped values in average
2. **Consistency Check**: Align all compensation logic with intended business rules

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Prevention
1. **Asset Checks**: Implement validation to prevent future compensation anomalies
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive validation across multi-year simulations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify
- `dbt/seeds/config_job_levels.csv`: Fix max_compensation values
- `dbt/models/intermediate/events/int_hiring_events.sql`: Fix avg_compensation calculation
- Add new asset checks for compensation validation

### Expected Outcomes
- New hire average compensation: $75K-$85K (realistic range)
- Level 4/5 compensation: $200K-$350K (appropriate for senior roles)
- Accurate prorated compensation reflecting actual employment periods
- Elimination of million-dollar salary assignments

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All new hire compensation between $60K-$350K
- [ ] Average new hire compensation $75K-$85K
- [ ] Prorated compensation accurately reflects employment periods
- [ ] Multi-year simulation maintains compensation consistency

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] No compensation outliers >$500K in any simulation year
- [ ] Compensation progression logical across levels 1-5
- [ ] Dashboard analytics show realistic compensation trends
- [ ] Asset checks prevent future compensation errors

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Data quality fix (CSV update) is straightforward
- Calculation logic change is isolated to one function

### Medium Risk
- Need to validate no regressions in promotion/merit logic
- Requires testing across all job levels and scenarios

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Backup of current state for rollback if needed
- Gradual rollout with validation at each step

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Completion of current Epic E011 (Workforce Simulation Validation)
- Access to modify seed data and dbt models

### Downstream Impact
- All compensation-related dashboards and reports
- Financial projection calculations
- Multi-year simulation accuracy

## Timeline

### Story Breakdown
- **S045**: Diagnose compensation anomaly (3 points) - 1 day
- **S046**: Fix job levels configuration (2 points) - 1 day
- **S047**: Fix calculation logic (5 points) - 2 days
- **S048**: Add validation checks (3 points) - 1 day
- **S049**: End-to-end validation (5 points) - 2 days

**Total Estimated Duration**: 5-7 business days

## Acceptance Criteria for Epic

### Data Quality
- [ ] No extreme compensation values (>$500K) in any simulation output
- [ ] Compensation ranges realistic for each organizational level
- [ ] Historical simulation results can be reproduced accurately

### System Integrity
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (no regressions)
- [ ] Compensation calculations mathematically sound
- [ ] Asset checks prevent future data quality issues

### Business Value
- [ ] Financial projections based on realistic compensation data
- [ ] Accurate cost modeling for workforce planning
- [ ] Reliable analytics for executive decision-making
