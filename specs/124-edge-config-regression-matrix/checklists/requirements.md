# Specification Quality Checklist: Edge-Configuration Regression Matrix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- PR #452 is treated as an existing dependency and source of general invariant/determinism coverage, not duplicated scope.
- Domain terms such as auto-enrollment, eligibility suppression, tenure-graded matching, and auto-escalation are retained because they name the business behavior under test.
- The original #438 proposal was intentionally reduced to four high-risk scenarios; broader combinations remain explicitly out of scope.
