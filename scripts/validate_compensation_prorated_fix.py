Validate Compensation Prorated Fix Script

This script validates that the compensation prorated calculation fix works correctly.
It runs a simulation with known test data (including the user's EMP_000003 scenario),
executes the dbt models, and validates that prorated compensation calculations match
expected values.

Key validations:
- Correct time-weighted calculations for mid-year raises
- Proper handling of multiple raises per employee per year
- Validation that current_compensation equals prorated_annual_compensation
- Comparison with the previous incorrect behavior to confirm the fix
