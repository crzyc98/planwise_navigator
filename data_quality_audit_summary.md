# Data Quality Audit Summary - PlanWise Navigator Simulation Database

**Audit Date:** July 28, 2025
**Database:** simulation.duckdb
**Auditor:** Claude Code Data Quality Auditor v1.0

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive data quality audit of the PlanWise Navigator simulation database identified **79 data quality issues** across **23 tables**. The primary issue causing DOUBLE to INT64 casting failures has been traced to the event stream architecture's handling of employee tenure calculations.

### Critical Findings

- **üî¥ 8 Critical Issues** - Primarily NULL values in critical numeric columns
- **üü° 37 Warning Issues** - Type casting vulnerabilities and data range anomalies
- **‚ùå 34 Error Issues** - Schema and query execution failures during validation

### Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue causing DOUBLE to INT64 casting failures is in the **event stream architecture design**:

1. **Tenure Calculation Pattern**: The `int_employee_event_stream` model intentionally sets `current_tenure` to NULL for all events except 'hire' and 'initial_state' (lines 74-77 in `/dbt/models/intermediate/int_employee_event_stream.sql`)

2. **Downstream Casting Issue**: The `fct_workforce_snapshot` model attempts to cast these NULL DOUBLE values to BIGINT on line 129, causing type casting failures

3. **Data Propagation**: This design pattern propagates NULL values through multiple downstream tables, affecting data quality across the entire pipeline

## Detailed Issue Breakdown

### 1. Tenure Data Quality Issues (Most Critical)

| Table | Column | NULL Count | NULL % | Impact |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| `fct_workforce_snapshot` | `current_tenure` | 3,895 | 74.1% | **CRITICAL** - Breaks casting logic |
| `int_employee_compensation_by_year` | `current_tenure` | 3,152 | 69.8% | High - Affects compensation calculations |
| `int_employee_event_stream` | `current_tenure` | 4,751 | 43.7% | High - Root cause location |

**Technical Details:**
- Event types affected: `raise`, `termination`, `promotion` events have NULL tenure by design
- Only `hire` and `initial_state` events maintain tenure values
- This creates inconsistent data state across the event timeline

### 2. Type Casting Vulnerabilities

**32 tables** contain DOUBLE columns with values that would fail INT64 casting:

**High-Impact Tables:**
- `fct_payroll_ledger`: 113,828 values at risk
- `fct_workforce_snapshot`: 4,104 compensation values
- `fct_yearly_events`: 3,939 compensation amounts

**Configuration Tables:**
- All configuration tables (`config_*`) contain fractional values designed as DOUBLE
- Casting these to INT64 would lose precision and break business logic

### 3. Event Storage Pattern Analysis

The audit revealed that the event storage follows a **temporal state pattern** where:

- **Initial State Events**: Contain complete employee data including tenure
- **Change Events**: Only contain changed attributes, leaving others as NULL
- **Final State Calculation**: Uses window functions to reconstruct employee state

**Issue**: This pattern conflicts with downstream models expecting complete attribute sets.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Critical Casting Issue (Priority: URGENT)

**File:** `/dbt/models/marts/fct_workforce_snapshot.sql`
**Line:** 129
**Current Code:**
```sql
CAST(current_tenure AS BIGINT) AS current_tenure,
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```sql
CAST(COALESCE(current_tenure, 0) AS BIGINT) AS current_tenure,
```

### 2. Implement Proper Tenure Calculation (Priority: HIGH)

**File:** `/dbt/models/intermediate/int_employee_event_stream.sql`
**Lines:** 74-77

**Current Logic:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN UPPER(event_type) = 'HIRE' THEN 0
    ELSE NULL
END AS current_tenure,
```

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN UPPER(event_type) = 'HIRE' THEN 0
    ELSE
        -- Calculate tenure from hire date to event date
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM effective_date) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM employee_hire_date)
END AS current_tenure,
```

### 3. Add Data Validation Framework (Priority: MEDIUM)

Create validation checks in the event processing pipeline:

1. **Pre-cast Validation**: Ensure no NULL values before type casting
2. **Range Validation**: Verify age (0-100), tenure (0-50), level_id (1-10)
3. **Consistency Checks**: Validate event sequences make business sense

### 4. Review Configuration Table Design (Priority: LOW)

Configuration tables containing fractional values should remain as DOUBLE:
- `comp_levers.parameter_value`
- `config_cola_by_year.cola_rate`
- All promotion/termination hazard multipliers

## Technical Recommendations

### Database Schema Improvements

1. **Add NOT NULL Constraints** where business logic requires values
2. **Implement CHECK Constraints** for data ranges
3. **Create Composite Indexes** on frequently joined columns
4. **Add Column Comments** documenting expected NULL patterns

### dbt Model Enhancements

1. **Implement dbt Tests** for critical data quality rules
2. **Add Model Contracts** with explicit data type definitions
3. **Create dbt Macros** for common validation patterns
4. **Enhance Documentation** with data lineage explanations

### Monitoring Framework

1. **Scheduled Data Quality Checks** using the auditor script
2. **Alert System** for critical data quality failures
3. **Dashboard Integration** showing data quality metrics
4. **Automated Reporting** to stakeholders

## Long-term Architecture Considerations

### Event Stream Design Pattern

The current event stream architecture has benefits but creates data quality challenges:

**Benefits:**
- Immutable audit trail
- Efficient storage of changes only
- Temporal state reconstruction capabilities

**Challenges:**
- Incomplete attribute sets in intermediate states
- Complex downstream processing requirements
- Type casting vulnerabilities

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a **hybrid approach**:
1. Maintain current event stream for audit purposes
2. Create **materialized snapshots** with complete attribute sets
3. Use snapshots for downstream processing and reporting

### Performance Considerations

The audit revealed several performance optimization opportunities:

1. **Reduce NULL Checking**: Pre-calculate tenure in event creation
2. **Optimize Window Functions**: Consider materialized intermediate results
3. **Index Strategy**: Add indexes on frequently filtered columns
4. **Partitioning**: Consider partitioning large tables by simulation_year

## Conclusion

The data quality audit successfully identified the root cause of DOUBLE to INT64 casting failures in the PlanWise Navigator simulation database. The primary issue stems from the event stream architecture's handling of employee tenure, where NULL values are intentionally introduced but not properly handled in downstream type casting operations.

**Immediate Impact:** Implementing the recommended fixes will resolve the casting failures and improve overall data quality.

**Long-term Value:** The comprehensive audit framework and recommendations will establish a foundation for ongoing data quality monitoring and continuous improvement.
