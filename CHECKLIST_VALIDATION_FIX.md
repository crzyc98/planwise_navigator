# Checklist Validation Error Fix

## Problem
When running the PlanWise Navigator orchestrator, you encounter this error:

```
❌ Cannot execute step 'workforce_baseline' for year 2025. Missing prerequisites: year_transition (year 2025). Please complete these steps first before proceeding.

❌ STEP SEQUENCE ERROR: Cannot execute step 'workforce_baseline' for year 2025. Missing prerequisites: year_transition (year 2025). Please complete these steps first before proceeding.
Use --force-step to override checklist validation if needed.
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurs in single-year mode because:

1. The `SimulationChecklist` class enforces step dependencies where `WORKFORCE_BASELINE` requires `YEAR_TRANSITION` to be complete
2. In multi-year mode, the orchestrator automatically marks `year_transition` as complete for the first year (2025)
3. In single-year mode, this step was missing, causing the validation to fail

## Solution 1: Fixed Code (Recommended)
The issue has been fixed by adding the missing step completion in `orchestrator_mvp/run_mvp.py`:

```python
# Step 6: Mark year_transition complete for single-year mode (matching multi-year logic)
if not multi_year:
    # For single year (2025), mark year transition as complete (no transition needed from baseline)
    single_year_checklist.mark_step_complete("year_transition", 2025)
```

This ensures single-year mode follows the same logic as multi-year mode.

## Solution 2: Bypass Validation (Workaround)
If you encounter this error on an unfixed version, you can bypass the validation using:

```bash
python -m orchestrator_mvp.run_mvp --force-step workforce_baseline
```

**Note**: This bypasses validation but allows the orchestrator to proceed.

## Solution 3: Manual Checklist Fix (Advanced)
If you need to fix this in your own code, add the missing step completion before the `workforce_baseline` validation:

```python
# Add this before trying to run workforce_baseline
if not multi_year:
    single_year_checklist.mark_step_complete("year_transition", 2025)
```

## Verification
The fix has been verified to work correctly:

```
✅ Step 1: pre_simulation marked complete
✅ Step 2: year_transition marked complete for 2025
✅ Step 3: workforce_baseline is ready - VALIDATION FIX SUCCESSFUL!
```

## Context
This fix aligns single-year mode behavior with multi-year mode, where the first year (2025) automatically has its `year_transition` step marked as complete since there's no actual transition from a previous year.
