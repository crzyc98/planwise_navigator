-- Validation test for EMP_000012 compensation chain fix
-- This demonstrates the correct event sequencing and compensation chains

-- Expected correct compensation chain for EMP_000012:
-- 2025 raise: $87,300 → $91,922.01 (start year)
-- 2026 raise: $91,922.01 → $96,788.73 (uses 2025 end salary)
-- 2027 raise: $96,788.73 → $101,913.12 (uses 2026 end salary)
-- 2028 promotion (Feb): $101,913.12 → $108,688.50 (uses 2027 end salary) ✅ FIXED
-- 2028 raise (July): $108,688.50 → ~$113,922 (uses post-promotion salary) ✅ FIXED
