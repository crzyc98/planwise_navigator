/*
Epic E035: Deferral Rate Escalation System - Unit Tests

This file contains focused unit tests for the escalation system components.
These tests can be run during development to validate individual model behavior.

Usage (from dbt directory):
    dbt run --select int_deferral_rate_escalation_events --vars "simulation_year: 2025"
    dbt test --select int_deferral_rate_escalation_events

Key Test Categories:
1. Event generation basic functionality
2. Business rule enforcement
3. Parameter integration
4. State accumulator logic
5. Data quality validations
