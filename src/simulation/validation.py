Simulation Validation and Testing Functions

This module contains pure business logic functions for validating simulation
results, testing data quality, and ensuring acceptance criteria compliance.
These functions are independent of the Dagster orchestration framework.

Functions:
    validate_year_results: Comprehensive validation of single year simulation results
    assert_year_complete: Strict validation that simulation data exists
    log_hiring_calculation_debug: Detailed hiring calculation debug information

Classes:
